      False. We've	sort	of	covered	the	idea	of	'waiting	till	they're	ready,'	but	let's	give it	some	more	thought.	
      What	does	a	parent	mean	by,	'I'm	going	to	wait	till	he gives	me	signals	that	he's	ready'?	What	signals?	
      Some	not-yet-potty-trained	kids start	 staying	 dry	 during	 naps,	 or	 wake	 up	 dry	 in	 the	 morning,	 but	 
      not	 usually. Some	kids	show	an	interest	in	the	toilet,	but	others	don't	ever	show	an	interest. Are	 you	 
      waiting	 for	 your	 child	 to	 wave	 a	 flag	 that	 says,	 'I	 have	 to	 pee'? Remember,	all	your	child	has	known	
      is	a	diaper.	What	signal	could	they	possibly give	when	they	don't	know	what	it	is	they	should	be	signaling?	
      Just	think	about it.	 How	do	you	signal	for	a	brand-new	action?	Once	potty	training	has	begun, sure,	your	
      child	will	have	signals.	For	instance,	she	might	do	a	pee-pee	dance. This	could	be	the	classic	hopping	from	foot	
      to	foot.	Other	'dances'	or	signals could	include	staying	completely	still.	You	might	notice	that	she	looks	antsy	
      or twitchy.	Regardless	of	your	individual	child's	signals	that	she	has	to	pee,	they develop	once	you've begun 
      potty	training,	not	before.	To	wait	for	a	signal	from your	child	that	he	is	ready	to	begin	potty	training	is	
      inviting	trouble.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          When should the signals be developed?
        answer: |
          The signals that a child needs to pee are developed once you have begun potty training, and not before starting.  
      - question: |
          What is one reason why a child might not be able to give you signals?
        answer: |
          All your child has known is a diaper, so it isn't conveivable that they could provide a signal when they don't 
          know what it is that they should be signaling.
      - question: |
          What is one signal once the child has started potty training?
        answer: |
          One signal could be hopping from foot to foot, staying completely still, or looking antsy or twitchy.
  - context: |
      A	very	common	complaint	I	hear	a	few	days	into	potty	training	is	something along	the	lines	of,	'He's	doing	fine	
      but	only	when	we	tell	him	to	go	.	.	.	is	this kid	EVER	going	to	tell	us	when	he	has	to	go??'

      My	answer	is:	OF	COURSE	he	will!

      But	right	now,	in	the	early	stages	of	potty	training,	your	child	needs	you.	It still	 counts	 if	 they	 pee	 
      in	 the	 potty	 because	 you	 tell	 them	 to.	 Like	 any	 other learning	 they	 have	 done	 or	 will	 do,	 
      they	 need	 you-the	 parent-as	 a	 crutch. Think	of	your	child	learning	to	walk.	They	had	to	hold	your	
      hands	at	first,	both for	the	physical	support	and	the	comfort.	Then	they	took	a	few	tentative	steps away	
      from	you	but	quickly	needed	your	hand	again.	In	strange	environments, they	 hold	 your	 hand	 to	 tug	 you	 
      along	 to	 where	 they	 want	 to	 investigate. Prompting	is	holding	their	hand.

      Some	 kids might immediately	 start	 to	 self-initiate.	 Most	 kids	 will	 build	 it slowly;	 usually	 about	 
      three	 weeks	 into	 the	 process,	 you	 can	 start	 counting	 on self-initiating.	Until	then,	it	will	be	a	
      few	days	of	you	always	prompting.	Then there	will	be	a	few	days	during	which	they	tell	you	maybe	one	or	
      two	times	that they	have	to	go.	Then,	every	once	in	a	while,	they	will	sit	on	their	own	and	do their	business.	
      It	will	continue	to	build.	And	in	strange	situations,	you	may	have to	 do	 some	 more	hand	holding.	And	one	
      day	you	will	wake	up	and	not	have potty	training	on	the	brain.	I	swear	to	God,	this	day	will	come.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is an analogy to how the child is learning to potty train?
        answer: |
          This is analogous to the child learning how to walk.  They had to hold your hands at first, for both support and comfort, 
          then taking steps, but relying on your hand.  Prompting is analogous to holding their hand in this context. 
      - question: |
          How many kids would start to self-initiate?
        answer: |
          Some kids might immediately start to self-initiate, mostly about three weeks into the process you can expect to count on 
          them to self-initiate.
      - question: |
          Will the day ever come when the child will be potty trained?
        answer: |
          One day you will wake up and not have potty training on the brain.  I swear to God, this day will come.
