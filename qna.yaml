      False. We've	sort	of	covered	the	idea	of	'waiting	till	they're	ready,'	but	let's	give it	some	more	thought.	
      What	does	a	parent	mean	by,	'I'm	going	to	wait	till	he gives	me	signals	that	he's	ready'?	What	signals?	
      Some	not-yet-potty-trained	kids start	 staying	 dry	 during	 naps,	 or	 wake	 up	 dry	 in	 the	 morning,	 but	 
      not	 usually. Some	kids	show	an	interest	in	the	toilet,	but	others	don't	ever	show	an	interest. Are	 you	 
      waiting	 for	 your	 child	 to	 wave	 a	 flag	 that	 says,	 'I	 have	 to	 pee'? Remember,	all	your	child	has	known	
      is	a	diaper.	What	signal	could	they	possibly give	when	they	don't	know	what	it	is	they	should	be	signaling?	
      Just	think	about it.	 How	do	you	signal	for	a	brand-new	action?	Once	potty	training	has	begun, sure,	your	
      child	will	have	signals.	For	instance,	she	might	do	a	pee-pee	dance. This	could	be	the	classic	hopping	from	foot	
      to	foot.	Other	'dances'	or	signals could	include	staying	completely	still.	You	might	notice	that	she	looks	antsy	
      or twitchy.	Regardless	of	your	individual	child's	signals	that	she	has	to	pee,	they develop	once	you've begun 
      potty	training,	not	before.	To	wait	for	a	signal	from your	child	that	he	is	ready	to	begin	potty	training	is	
      inviting	trouble.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          When should the signals be developed?
        answer: |
          The signals that a child needs to pee are developed once you have begun potty training, and not before starting.  
      - question: |
          What is one reason why a child might not be able to give you signals?
        answer: |
          All your child has known is a diaper, so it isn't conveivable that they could provide a signal when they don't 
          know what it is that they should be signaling.
      - question: |
          What is one signal once the child has started potty training?
        answer: |
          One signal could be hopping from foot to foot, staying completely still, or looking antsy or twitchy.
