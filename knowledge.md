Jamie's	Top	Twelve	Questions	From	Parents

About	the	Author

## Introduction

W elcome	 to Oh	 Crap!	 Potty	 Training .	 This	 is	 the	 definitive	 guide	 to	 potty training.	 I'm	 Jamie,	 and	 I	 will	 be	 your	 tour	 guide	 on	 this	 really	 cool	 journey. What?	Cool	journey?	Yep,	you	heard	right.	The	first	step	I	want	you	to	take	in beginning	potty	training	is	to	wrap	your	head	around	what	a	very	cool	milestone this	is.	Walking	and	talking,	learning	to	read	and	tie	shoes	and	ride	bikes	are	all really	 cool	 milestones	 that	 we,	 as	 parents, look	 forward to.	 Potty	 training, however,	fills	us	with	dread,	right?	It	shouldn't.	One	of	the	coolest	things	I've discovered	about	potty	training	is	that	it's	your	first	glimpse	into how your	child learns.	Every	child	learns-and	therefore	potty	trains-a	little	differently,	and you	get	great	insight	into	your	child's	learning	methods	and	curve.

If	you	don't	know	my	history	as	a	potty	trainer,	you	can	check	my	bio	on	the website (http://www.jamieglowacki.com). Despite a solid decade of potty training	experience,	my	business	exploded	when	in	2011	when	I	began	to	work with	lots	of	people	all	at	the	same	time,	which	gave	me	insight	into	emerging new	 trends,	 new	 problems,	 and	 new	 parenting	 methods	 and	 styles.	 I	 also discovered	that	there	really	isn't	 one	 method	for	potty	training,	because	even though	there's	a	necessary	component	to	all	successful	methods-to	potty	train, you	must	take	the	diapers	off	the	child-children	are	different	and	respond	to different	approaches.	In	this	book,	I'm	going	to	teach	you	the	most	painless	way to	get	your	child	out	of	diapers,	but	more	important,	I'm	going	to	present	the answers	to	any	questions	you	might	have	going	forward	from	that	point.	Bottom line:	 all	 kids	 react	 differently	 to	 not	 wearing	 a	 diaper,	 and	 that,	 my	 friends,	 is what	everyone	fears.	We'll	get	into	all	the	nitty-gritty	details	soon	enough.	First, though,	I	need	to	do	some	myth	busting,	and	you	need	to	do	some	mental	prep.

Then	I'll	walk	you	through	the	first	few	days	of	potty	training,	and	finally,	we'll get	to	all	the	potential	questions	you	might	have.

I	 used	 to	 call	 this	 a	 three-day	 plan.	 There's	 a	 reason	 there	 are	 a	 million 'three-day	potty	training	methods'	out	there	on	the	internet.	It	takes	roughly three	days	for	the	average	child	to	get	over	the	major	hump	of	potty	training. But	your	child	is	 unique,	 as	 is	 your	 relationship	 with	 her.	 Every	 child	 has	 his own	learning	curve,	and-this	is	a	big and -you	have	an	emotional	investment in	this.	One	of	the	reasons	I	can	potty	train	someone	else's	child	in	a	day	is	that I	 don't	 have	 an	 emotional	 investment.	 It's	 not my child.	 You	 and	 your	 child have	 a	 wonderfully	 strong	 bond;	 this	 is	 to	 both	 your	 advantage	 and	 your disadvantage.	So,	yes,	some	bumps	can	appear	on	this	road.	Over	the	years,	I've found	that	some	parents	get	all	wrapped	up	in	potty	training	in	three	days	flat. This	creates	the	very	pressure	you	want	to	avoid	when	potty	training.	If	you	put pressure	on	the	process,	it	will	collapse.

I'll	also	throw	this	in:	we	all	know	how	very	different	our	children	are	from one	 another,	 and	 yet	 somehow	 the	 media	 has	 led	 us	 to	 think	 that	 there's	 a cookie-cutter	version	of	potty	training	that	will	work	for	every	kid.	Impossible. How	could	one	way	work	identically	 on	 very	 different	 people?	 Kind	 of	 weird when	you	think	of	it	that	way,	isn't	it?

It	will	take	most	kids	about	three	to	seven	days	for	the	potty	training	to	click. For	some	kids,	the	process	may	be	longer,	while	for	others,	it	will	be	shorter.	You won't	know	what	kind	of	kid	you	have	until	you	jump	in,	but	no	matter	how	fast or	 slow	 the	 process	 is,	 it's	 all	 okay	 and	 expected.	 It's	 the	 same	 as	 learning	 to read.	Some	kids	pick	it	up	quickly	and	seemingly	intuitively,	while	others	take longer	to	string	letters	together	into	sounds	(the	latter	is	more	common,	btw). I'm	going	to	give	you	markers	to	track progress ,	because	that's	what's	important here.	This	whole	thing	is	about	progress,	not	perfection.	What	we	are	going	to be	doing	is	bringing	your	child's	awareness	from	Clueless	to	I	Peed	to	I'm	Peeing to	I	Have	to	Go	Pee.	That's	it.	Each	segment	can	take	roughly	a	day.	Some	kids cruise	through	one	component	and	stall	out	on	another.	Again,	we	won't	know until	you	jump	in.

You	should	notice	that	nothing	here	is	written	in	stone	as	an	absolute.	We are	dealing	with	little	human	beings.	Their	brains	aren't	mature	yet,	but	these little	 people	 are	 very	 capable	 of	 thinking	 their	 own	 thoughts,	 and	 they	 come chock-full	 of	 their	 own	 personalities.	 I'm	 passionate	 about	 potty	 training because	of	the	many	differences	between	one	child	and	another,	so	having	said that,	 you	 need	 to	 keep	 your	 child's	 individual	 personality	 in	 the	 front	 of	 your mind	as	you	go	through	this	process,	yes?

On	that	note,	what	you	are	reading	is	a	curriculum.	I	don't	hold	the	magic keys.	You	do.	I	am	a	potty	training	expert,	but	you	are	the	expert	on	your	child. If	 I	 say	 something	 that	 doesn't	 resonate,	 ditch	 it.	 I	 do	 my	 best	 to	 back	 up everything	I	say	with	a	healthy	dose	of why ,	but	I'm	happy	to	be	wrong.

A	few	quick	side	notes	before	we	begin.	Throughout	this	book,	I've	shared	a lot	of	blog	posts	I've	written.	I	highly	suggest	you	subscribe	to	my	blog.	I	learn new	 things	 every	 day	 from	 clients,	 and	 I	 keep	 my	 thoughts	 very	 up	 to	 the minute	there.	Plus,	I've	been	told	I'm	funny.

In	 using	 this	 book,	 I	 highly	 recommend	 you	 read	 up	 through	 chapter	 5, 'Ditch	the	Diapers!	The	How-To.'	I've	kept	the	how-to	as	simple	as	possible, because	some	people	cruise	right	through	the	process	with	nary	a	question.	The rest	 of	 the	 book	 is	 all-and	 I	 mean all -I	know	about	potty	 training.	 It's	 an overwhelming	number	of	what-ifs	and	how	to	fix	them.	This	sort	of	thing	may be	your	idea	of	fun	reading,	but	I	don't	recommend	overwhelming	yourself	with potential	problems	that	may	never	exist	for	you.

I	 will	 mention	 clients	 and	 specific	 situations	 throughout.	 For	 privacy,	 all names	have	been	changed.	I've	also	blended	various	scenarios	for	brevity.

I	cuss,	my	humor	has	been	termed	'sick,'	and	I'm	pretty	sarcastic.	It's	not	out of	disrespect.	I	make	my	living	talking	about	poop;	I	have	to	have	some	levity.	I don't	 mean	 to	 offend,	 nor	 do	 I	 take	 such	 a	 major	 milestone	 lightly.	 Still, sometimes	no	word	other	than	'f**k'	will	do.

I'm	thrilled	you've	chosen	me	to	help	you	on	this	journey.	Now	.	.	.	are	you ready	to	kick	some	potty	training	butt?

## CHAPTER	1

## In	the	Beginning	.	.	.

F irst	off,	although	I'll	admit	that	I	really	like	the	word crap ,	I	tend	to	use pee and poop with	my	own	child,	and	those	are	the	words	I'll	use	in	this	book.	I	think they	 are	 pretty	 commonplace	 and	 fit	 the	 bill	 nicely.	 However,	 don't	 feel	 you have	to	use	them.	You	should	decide	on	your	own	family's	lingo.	Any	words	will do,	as	long	as	there	is	consistency.

One	thing	I'll	be	talking	about	quite	a	lot	is	mixed	messages.	We	send	our children	many	mixed	messages	about	potty	training,	and	I	think	that's	one	of the	 reasons	 it's	 become	 such	 a	 huge	 ordeal.	 The	 words	 you	 use	 are	 just	 one example.	I	don't	care	if	you	choose	to	say	poop,	crap,	she-she,	urine,	BM,	peeps, caca,	 doody,	 lala,	 foofoo	 .	 .	 .	 whatever.	 Just	 be	 consistent.	 Bear	 in	 mind,	 this word	will	be	said very	loudly in	church,	at	the	library,	in	the	market.	Be	sure	it's a	 word	 you	 are	 comfortable	 with	 at	 high	 volume	 and	 frequency.	 I've	 worked with	parents	who	say	'caca'	at	home	and	then	try	to	get	away	with	'BM'	in public.	The	toddler	mind	doesn't	work	that	way.	Don't	confuse	the	issue.

Regarding	the	term	'potty	training,'	I	know	some	parents	object	to	the	term. I've	heard	it	said	that	training	is	for	animals,	not	children.	Let's	just	agree	that 'training'	is	synonymous	with	'learning'	for	our	purposes.	After	all,	even	as	an adult,	you	'train'	in	something	in	order	to	learn	it.	As	an	analogy,	when	you	get a	 new	 job,	 you	 receive	 training.	 Someone	 already	 skilled	 guides	 you	 through your	new	duties.	On	your	first	day	of	work,	does	your	boss	sit	and	wait	for	your cues	that	you're	ready?	Ready	for	what?	When	you	make	a	mistake,	does	your boss	 get	 distraught	 and	 fire	 you?	 No.	 Most	 likely,	 you	 are	 clearly	 told	 what	 is expected	of	you	and	shown	how	to	do	it.	When	you	make	mistakes,	your	boss gently	tells	you	what	you	did	wrong	and	how	do	it	right.	After	a	certain	amount of	time,	you're	expected	to	have	mastered	your	new	duties.	There	you	go-that's potty	training.

I	 also	 like	 to	 compare	 potty	 training	 to	 learning	 to	 walk.	 I've	 always	 been amazed	by	kids	learning	to	walk.	Let's	face	it-they	get	around	much	faster	by crawling.	So	why	take	on	this	new	skill?	Because	it's	in	our	nature	as	humans	to walk	upright.	It's	also	in	our	nature	to	pee	and	poop	in	designated	areas.	Even cultures	that	don't	have	plumbing	have	definitive	places	for	excrement.

Think	back	to	when	your	child	learned	to	walk.	You	probably	watched	her constantly	to	make	sure	she	didn't	whack	her	head	on	something.	You	put	her between	your	legs	and	held	her	hands	and	helped	her	along.	You	cheered	her	on and	smothered	her	with	kisses.	You	showed	off	her	new	skill	to	anyone	who	set foot	in	your	house.	When	she	fell	and	cried,	you	picked	her	up,	dusted	her	off, and	encouraged	her	to	try	again.	Did	you	give	her	stickers	or	M&amp;Ms	for	learning to	walk?	Did	you	beg	and	plead	and	ask	her	a	million	times	a	day	if	she	felt	like walking?	Did	you	get	all	freaked	out?	Did	you	consult	everyone	you	knew	and research	 the	 topic	 endlessly?	 Probably	 not.	 You	 knew	 your	 child	 should	 start walking	around	twelve	months,	give	or	take	a	couple	of	months	on	either	side. You	might	have	bought	a	little	push	toy	to	help	the	process.	You would have been	concerned	if	she	were	eighteen	months	old	and	not	showing	any	sign	of walking.	Generally	speaking,	you	probably	used	your	parental	intuition	and	your knowledge	of	your	child	to	help	her	learn	how	to	walk.

Ideally,	you'll	have	a	similar	philosophy	toward	potty	training.

One	thing	I've	always	found	bizarre	is	that	parents	assume	that	potty	training is	 just	 something	 the	 child	 is	 going	 to	 pick	 up.	 Why	 would	 they?	 They might realize	it's	in	their	future,	but	so	is	driving.	The	need	to	pee	and	poop	is	a	primal one;	learning	to	put	it	somewhere	specific	is	social,	and	social	behavior	must	be taught.

I	 like	 to	 remind	 parents	 that	 kids	 don't	 know	 the	 beauty	 of	 potty	 training. The	 only	 thing	 they	 know	 is	 the	 comfort	 and	 safety	 of	 wearing	 a	 diaper. This	 is completely	 uncharted	 territory.	 Since	 coming	 out	 of	 the	 womb,	 all	 they've known	is	a	snug	diaper.	Seriously:	some	babies	have	a	diaper	on	before	their	first nursing!	It's	 like	 the	 ultimate	 security	 blanket.	 This	 is	 especially	 important	 to remember	if	you're	met	with	resistance.	Not	wearing	a	diaper	can	feel	strange, uncomfortable,	 and	 unsafe	 to	 a	 small	 child.	 It's	 your	 job	 to	 guide	 your	 child through	 this	 new	 territory.	 After	 all,	 using	 the	 potty	 is	 a	 skill	 you've	 already mastered.	Well,	let's	hope	so	anyway.

So	 let's	 get	 down	 to	 the	 nitty-gritty.	 The	 number	 one	 question	 I'm	 most asked	is	'What's	the	trick?'	Are	you	ready	for	the	trick?	The	Big	Trick	of	Potty Training?	Memorize	this.	Study	it	intently.	Are	you	sure	you're	ready?

YOU.

Let	me	repeat	that.	You,	you,	you,	you,	you,	you.

YOU	 are	 the	 parent.	 YOU	 provide	 safety	 and	 boundaries	 for	 your	 child. YOU	are	 the	 teacher.	 YOU	 provide	 a	 loving	 environment	 where	 it's	 safe	 to grow.	Again,	YOU	provide	the	boundaries.	It	is	your	job	to	nurture	your	child	to their	fullest	potential.	It's	your	job	to	instill	dignity	and	self-respect.

More	 than just you, it's your commitment . This is a big deal, your commitment.	Potty	training	is	not	rocket	science	by	any	means.	I	can	tell	you what	to	do	until	I'm	blue	in	the	face,	but	until	you	decide	you	are	committed	to the	process,	it's	not	going	to	fly	with	your	child.

When	I	say	'commitment,'	I	mean	your	commitment	to	consistency.	This	is a	 new	skill	you	are	teaching	your	child.	Humans	learn	by	repetition.	I	repeat: humans	learn	by	repetition.

Even	as	an	adult,	have	you	learned	a	skill	and	then	not	used	it	consistently and	lost	it?	Of	course	you	have.	Pick	a	skill.	I've	tried	to	learn	knitting	for	years. I	start,	and	then	I	don't	do	it	enough,	and	I	forget.	I	have	to	learn	all	over	again every	 time.	 It's	 ever	 so	 slightly	 easier	 the	 next	 time,	 but	 not	 by	 much.	 How about	 playing	 a	 musical	 instrument?	 Consistent	 practice	 is	 vital.	 Very	 few people	make	significant	progress	by	playing	just	once	in	a	while.	Think	of	your job. Skills that	 are	 now	 second	 nature	 once	 took	 a	 lot	 of	 thought	 and concentration.	After	enough	repetition,	things	just	sink	in.

While	potty	training,	you	need	to	be	consistent	and	firm.	By	firm,	I	mean 'without	 question,'	 not	 aggressive	 or	 pushy.	 I	 would	 say firm can	 be	 a	 pretty contentious	word	in	parenting	these	days.	I	have	so	many	clients	who	are	afraid of	being	firm.	Being	firm	and	meaning	business	is good ,	 and	it	doesn't	have	to look	mean.	Many	modern	parents	are	afraid	of	being	an	authoritative	presence in	their	homes.	Most	of	the	time	this	is	because	their	parents	were	over-the-top authoritative	 (authoritarian),	 and	 it	 left	 a	 sour	 taste	 in	 their	 mouth	 and/or resulted	in	years	of	therapy.	Still,	there's	a	happy	medium.	Your	child	needs	you to	be	the	authority	figure	and	wants	you	to	be	in	charge.	To	have	no	boundaries is	 like	 a	 free	 fall	 through	 life.	 So	 don't	 be	 afraid	 of	 being	 assertive	 and	 firm. Again,	 not	 mean,	 not	 aggressive	 or	 pushy.	 We'll	 definitely	 touch	 on	 this throughout	the	book	for	clarity.

Consistency	is	how	your	child	learns	effortlessly.	 How	 many	 times	 did	 you sing	the	ABC	song	before	your	child	sang	it	through	by	herself?	Did	you	sing	it	a couple	 of	 times	 every	 couple	 of	 weeks	 and	 then	 expect	 her	 to	 sing	 it	 for Grandma?	I	don't	know	about	you,	but	I	think	I	sang	that	song	twenty	times	an hour,	over	and	over	and	over.	Remember,	too,	that children	love	consistency .	All children,	even	adventurous	children,	love	routine.	Read	it	again.	Sing	it	again. Build	it	again.	Things	we	repeat	feel	safe	to	our	kids.	They	know	what	to	expect and	are	prepared.	Spirited	children,	especially,	need	and	crave	routine.

It's	amazing	to	me	that	we	would	expect	a	child	to	step	up	to	the	task	of	potty training	without	this	consistency.	Examples	of	inconsistency	are	to	occasionally have	 them	 go	 on	 the	 pot	 but	 sometimes	 put	 on	 a	 diaper,	 or	 to	 sometimes demand	they	go	on	the	pot	but	other	times	let	it	slide.	This	results	in	such	a constant	giving	and	taking	away	of	responsibility	that	it's	no	wonder	so	many power	struggles	ensue.	Doesn't	that	make	sense?	It	does	to	me,	and	yet	I	often hear	these	statements:

- 'We	don't	really	care	right	now.'

'We're	going	to	wait	till	she's	ready.'

'We're	just	being	really	casual	about	it.'

## 'We	don't	really	care	right	now.'

What	 I	 think	 people	 mean	 when	 they	 say	 this	 is	 that	 they're	 not	 really committed-that	it's	not	a	high	priority	in	their	lives	right	now.	Which	is	fine. Just	be	honest	with	yourself.	If	it's	not	a	high	priority	with	you,	it's	not	going	to be	a	high	priority	for	your	child	either.	I	spend	a	great	deal	of	time	in	my	classes on	this	topic.	Often,	parents	realize	that	they	are	afraid	to	commit	because	they don't	know	what	to	do	and	they're	concerned	that	they	might	fail.

More	often,	though,	parents	feel	something	along	the	lines	of,	'Eh	.	.	.	we	just don't	feel	like	it's	 that	 important	right	now,'	'We	are	doing	other	things,'	or 'What's	 the	 rush?	 She'll	 do	 it.	 I	 mean,	 she's	 not	 going	 to	 college	 in	 diapers, right?'	 True,	 your	 child	 is	 most	 likely	 not	 going	 to	 college	 in	 diapers.	 But	 I routinely	get	clients	who've	had	to	delay	preschool	because	of	a	lack	of	potty training.	 Last	 September,	 two	 sets	 of	 parents	 came	 to	 me	 after	 their	 children were	 asked	 to	 leave	 kindergarten	 for	 not	 being	 trained	 properly.	 So	 yeah,	 it might	not	be	vital	right	this	minute,	but	it's	going	to	creep	up	on	you	faster	than you	know.	And	I'll	be	beating	this	particular	horse	till	it's	good	and	dead:	the longer	you	wait	to	potty	train,	the	harder	it	gets.

Another	 reason	 behind	 the	 'we	 don't	 care'	 attitude	 is	 that	 something	 is happening	in	your	life	and	you	know	you	can't	give	potty	training	the	attention it	needs.	That's	completely	understandable if there's	actually	going	to	be	a	break in	 the	 action	 at	 some	 point.	 I	 remember	 a	 mom	 emailing	 me.	 She	 and	 her husband	were	both	medical	residents,	and	she	was	expecting	her	second	child. She	felt	life	was	too	hectic	to	potty	train.	To	this,	I	responded,	'It's	not	going	to be	any	less	hectic	for	your	family	for	a	good	long	time.'	True,	if	you	are	moving or	traveling,	now	might	not	be	the	best	time	to	potty	train.	But	if	your	life	itself is	busy,	you	are	going	to	have	to	carve	out	some	time	regardless.

I	won't	lie	to	you.	This	process	is	going	to	require	attention	and	focus	on	your part.	 Potty	training	is	all	you	will	be	thinking	about	for	at	least	a	week	or	so. However,	it	will	be-it	should	be-effortless	on	your	child's	part.

Do	I	think	it	should	be	a	high	priority	no	matter	what's	happening	in	your life	right	now?	Yes,	absolutely.	Here's	why:

- 1. Environment. One	year	of	one	child	using	disposable	diapers	uses	two	full	grown	trees.	Do	the math,	and	it's	downright	scary.	There's	just	no	reason	to	prolong	diaper	use.	Even	if	you	use	solely cloth-which	very	few	people	do-you're	still	using	valuable	resources	such	as	water	for	cotton processing	and	diaper	washing.
- 2. Landfill	space. It's	estimated	that	disposable	diapers	take	anywhere	from	two	hundred	fifty	to	five hundred	years	to	decompose.	They	are	accumulating	in	our	landfills	at	an	alarming	rate.	What's worse	is	very	few	people	dispose	of	the	poop	in	the	toilet	before	throwing	away	the	diaper-did

you	even	know	you're	supposed	to	do	that?-so	there's	the	added	problem	of	raw	sewage	in	our landfills.

- 3. Your	child's	dignity. This	is	one	I'll	repeat	over	and	over.	We	both	know	just	how	smart	your child	is.	Doesn't	he	deserve	the	dignity	of	not	crapping	in	a	diaper	and	still	worse,	sitting	in	it? Really	 think	 about	 that.	 Think	 about	 where	 your	 child	 is	 developmentally	 and	 just	 how undignified	this	is.	I	hear	parents	talk	about	giving	their	child	self-esteem.	Self-esteem	comes	from mastering	a	task,	from	gaining	dignity	and	self-respect.	Potty	training	is	a	way	you	can	give	this	to your	child.

## 'We're	going	to	wait	till	she's	ready.'

Oh.	Boy.	As	reasons	for	delaying	potty	training	go,	this	is	the	big	one.	I'd	say this	 particular	 rationale	 is	 responsible	 for	 more	 potty	 training	 drama	 than	 any other.	If	you	really	follow	this	thought	through,	it	doesn't	make	any	sense.	First, I'd	 like	 to	 point	 out	 some	 realities	 of	 toddlerhood.	 In	 what	 other	 area	 of development	do	you	wait	until	your	child	is	ready?	Do	you	wait	until	he's	ready to	go	to	bed?	(I	sincerely	hope	not.	That's	another	book	entirely.)	How	about when	your	toddler	decides	she's	ready	to	play	with	knives?	If	you	have	errands	to run,	 do	 you	 stay	 home	 until	 your	 toddler	 is	 ready	 to	 leave	 the	 house?	 What about	if	she's	not	ready	to	get	in	her	car	seat?	Do	you	drive	off	anyway?

I'm	being	a	bit	facetious,	of	course,	but	I'm	just	trying	to	point	out	that	there are	nonnegotiables	with	our	children.	We	don't	let	toddlers	decide	too	much	on their	own;	their	brains	just	aren't	fully	formed	yet.	We	are	constantly	deciding things	for	them,	for	their	well-being,	developmental	and	emotional	growth,	and safety.	These	nonnegotiables	exist	simply	because	we,	as	the	more	experienced humans,	understand	some	things	better	than	our	toddlers	do.

One	of	 my	 favorite	 books	 in	 the	 parenting	 world	 is Simplicity	 Parenting by Kim	John	Payne.	The	most	fabulous	concept	I	got	from	his	book	is	that	we	are, in	 general,	 offering	 our	 children	 too	 many	 choices.	 Further,	 we	 are	 expecting them	 to	 have	 the	 thought	 processes	 of	 an	 adult.	 Children	 don't	 have	 fully developed	frontal	lobes,	which	are	responsible	for	judgment.	We	cannot	present them	 with	 unlimited	 choices.	 If	 we	 do,	 they	 will	 not	 make	 good	 long-term choices.	To	expect	them	to	do	so	is	to	rush	childhood,	which	is	wild	when	you think	about	it.	I	feel	that	the	idea	of	'waiting	till	they	are	ready'	falls	into	the category	of	giving	the	toddler	more	choices	than	he	can	reasonably	handle.

In	 my	 experience,	 'waiting	 till	 they	 are	 ready'	 leads	 to	 disasters.	 You've probably	heard,	unless	you	live	in	a	cave,	that	'ready'	is	around	three	years.	Not so.	 That's	 past	 ready.	 Once	 a	 child	 is	 three,	 he	 is	 well	 into	 the	 process	 of individualization,	 which	 is	 the	 process	 by	 which	 he	 begins	 to	 realize	 he	 is	 his own	person	and	has	his	own	free	will	and	can	make	his	own	choices.	Hmmm. What	do	you	suppose	will	happen	if	he	decides	he	doesn't	want	to	use	the	potty and	that	the	diaper	is	working	just	fine	for	him?

I'll	 tell	 you	 what	 will	 happen:	 you'll	 have	 a	 drama-filled	 disaster.	 It's	 really hard	to	potty	train	children	over	three.	They	have	free	will,	and	they	know	how to	use	it.

So	this	notion	of	'waiting	till	they're	ready'	is	somewhat	ludicrous.	You	are going	 to	 have	 to	 give	 potty	 training	 some	 attention	 and	 focus,	 whether	 you tackle	it	when	your	child	is	two,	three,	four,	five,	or	six	years	old.	Regardless	of the	 child's	 age,	 she	 is	 still	 going	 to	 need	 your	 attention,	 help,	 and	 guidance. Please	 don't	 wait	 until	 she	 is	 beyond	 four-talk	 about	 giving	 her	 low	 selfesteem.	If	you	wait	that	long,	you	should	probably	save	for	therapy,	not	college.

There's	also	the	question	of	what,	exactly,	'ready'	means.	If	you	are	waiting for	a	magical	day	when	your	child	up	and	decides	diapers	are	no	longer	for	him and	just	does	his	business	on	the	toilet,	keep	dreaming.	This	child	is	a	fictional character.	Okay,	not	completely	fictional,	but	this	child	is extremely rare.	 And no	matter	what	you've	heard	about	other	parents'	kids,	I	have	to	be	honest-I think	some	moms	who	say	their	kid	just	decided	on	his	own	one	day	have	sort	of fudged	 the	 details.	 I	 know	 this	 is	 shocking,	 but	 some	 moms	 are	 competitive. Also,	I	think	potty	training	pains	are	like	labor	pains:	the	details	get	fuzzy	over time.

I'd	 say	 my	 biggest	 fight	 as	 a	 potty	 trainer	 is	 this	 'wait	 till	 they	 are	 ready' business.	The	only	reason	I	do	fight	is	for	the	kids;	in	my	job,	I	have	the	dubious luxury	of	seeing	big	numbers,	and	I	see	where	this	can	lead.	Frankly,	it	can	lead to	full-blown	disasters.	It	can	lead	to	six-year-olds	requesting	diapers	so	they	can poop.	 A	 friend	 of	 mine	 told	 me	 about	 a	 parenting	 forum	 where	 a	 mom	 was talking	 about	 her	 six-year-old	 wearing	 pull-ups	 to	 his	 first	 sleepover.	 He	 was mortified	when	he	got	home.	He	told	his	mom,	'This	is	your	fault.'	There	you have	it.	Despite	all	this,	the	other	moms	on	the	forum	were	saying	things	like, 'Don't	worry.	He'll	do	it	when	he's	ready.'	OMG.	So	maybe	some	kids will be going	to	college	in	diapers.

The	whole	point	is	this:	some	kids	will	never	be	'ready'	on	their	own.	Also, trying	to	potty	train	an	older	child	is	hard.	I	also	suspect	that	the	muscles	used to	control	holding	and	releasing	pee	and	poop	are	developing	around	two	years of	age.	If	you	wait	beyond	three	years	of	age	to	potty	train,	it's	as	though	these muscles	 have	 learned	 to not be	 able	 to	 hold	 the	 pee.	 This	 is	 my	 own	 theory based	upon	what	I	know	about	muscle	development,	combined	with	the	large number	of	incontinence	issues	I've	seen	in	kids	over	three.

Dr.	 T.	 Berry	 Brazelton	 is	 a	 very	 famous	 pediatrician	 who	 has	 become	 the foremost	advocate	of	late	potty	training.	He's	promoted	late	potty	training	and the	whole	'wait	till	they're	ready	theory'	since	the	1960s	and	pretty	aggressively at	 that.	 It	 also	 turns	 out	 that	 he	 was	 a	 paid	 spokesperson	 for	 Pampers.	 Pretty clear	conflict	of	interest,	don't	you	think?	Bear	in	mind	that	disposable	diapers are	a	$450-billion-a-year	business,	so	there's	a	pretty	high	stake	in	keeping	you mucked	up	about	potty	training.	If	you'd	like	to	read	my	very	hard-core	view (meaning,	I	drop	the	f-bomb	every	two	sentences)	you	can	check	out	my	blog post	'I'm	Pissed	and	I'm	Naming	Names.'

Rather	 than	 thinking	 about	 readiness,	 I'd	 like	 you	 to	 think	 in	 terms	 of capability,	as	in,	'Is	my	child	capable	of	learning	this	right	now?'

In	expressing	this	idea	to	parents,	I	often	use	the	example	of	my	son	learning to	tie	his	shoes.	He	never	really	asked	me	if	he	could	learn	this	skill,	and	Velcro had	 certainly	 made	 my	 life	 easier.	 Still,	 I	 know	 that	 learning	 to	 tie	 shoes generally	 happens	 sometime	 around	 kindergarten,	 and	 I	 think	 it's	 a	 pretty important	life	skill.	I	therefore	made	a	concerted	effort,	once	he	hit	that	age,	to buy	only	shoes	with	laces.	I	knew	if	I	bought	Velcro,	I'd	cave	in	to	the	morning rush.	Life	will	always	happen,	so	if	we	want	to	change	something,	we	have	to make	an	effort.	I	set	aside	thirty	minutes	every	morning	to	teach	my	son	to	tie his	shoes.	There	was	a	fair	amount	of	frustration;	the	worst	was	on	my	part	for feeling	that	I	was	inept	or	that	I	was	not	being	a	good	teacher,	despite	the	fact that	I've	been	tying	shoes	for	years.	The	whole	process	required	a	fair	amount	of patience	from	us	both.	Still,	after	six	days	of	consistently	attending	to	this	task, voilà!	My	son	can	tie	his	own	shoes.	Did	he	show	signs	of	readiness?	No,	not really.	 Rather,	 I	 used	 an	 outside	 age	 marker	 and	 my	 'Spidey	 Mom	 Sense'	 to determine	that	he	was capable .

In	my	experience,	many	not-yet-potty-trained	kids	are	capable,	and	may	even show	outward	signs	of	readiness.	But	I	think	in	our	very	busy	lives,	these	subtle signs	go	undetected.	I	also	think	most	people	think	the	desire	and	willingness	to sit	and	go	potty	on	the	toilet	will	increase	with	time.	As	in,	if	he	asks	to	go	on the	potty	once	in	a	while	right	now,	next	month	he	will	be	asking	to	go	every day.	Again,	this	is	just	my	experience,	but	I've	found	that	if	you	don't	seize	the appropriate	window,	the	kid	just	moves	on	and	forgets	about	it.	In	other	words, the	 interest	 in	 using	 the	 toilet	 does	 not	 increase	 exponentially	 with	 time-it peaks	and	goes	away.

Most	moms,	probably	including	you,	are	reading	this	book	because	you	know deep	in	your	heart	that	your	child	is	ready.	Go	with	that	feeling.	I'm	going	to help	you	tap	into	your	own	intuition	about	potty	training.	I'm	a	big	believer	in 'go	with	your	gut.'

## 'We're	just	being	really	casual	about	it.'

I	hear	this	one	a	lot,	and	to	some	extent,	it's	fine.	Just	know	that	if	you're	really casual	about	potty	training,	your	child	will	also	be	really	casual	about	it.	I	should clarify	that	by	'casual,'	I	don't	mean	you	have	a	casual	demeanor.	I	mean	you have	your	child	pee	in	the	potty	once	or	twice	a	day,	or	you	sometimes	put	a diaper	on	him	and	sometimes	don't.	The	problem	with	this	approach	is	there comes	a	time	when	it's	no	longer	appropriate.	Maybe	your	chosen	preschool	or kindergarten	won't	allow	your	child	attend	untrained.	Or	you	were	fine	with	the casual	approach	for	a	two-or	three-year	old,	but	now	your	child	is	four,	and	you feel	like	it's	time	to	get	serious.	Stay	casual	too	long	and	you	will	have	missed the	window	of	opportunity;	consequently,	it	becomes	infinitely	harder	to	train the	child.	You'll	be	facing	nothing	but	power	struggles,	and	your	life	will	turn into	a	living	hell.

I	also	think	'being	casual	about	it'	sends	a	very	mixed	message.	Let's	look	at this	 through	 toddler	 eyes.	 Remember	 toddlers	 are	 sponges;	 they	 learn	 very quickly.	 Also	 remember	 that	 toddlers	 are	 linear	 thinkers	 with	 no	 concept	 of time.	Let's	say	you	start	with	casual	potty	training.	You	announce	that	you	are potty	training,	but	what	you	mean	is	that	you	are	going	to	have	your	child	pee when	it's	convenient,	such	as	in	the	morning	before	getting	dressed.	Or	in	the evening	 before	 bath.	 Your	 child	 is	 going	 to	 literally	 learn	 this:	 potty	 training means	peeing	on	the	potty sometimes ,	but	not	all	the	time.

Let's	 say	 you	 take	 this	 approach	 for	 about	 a	 year,	 which	 is	 what	 usually happens.	 Then	 the	 time	 comes	 when	 the	 potty	 training	 needs	 to	 be done already.	You	say,	'Okay,	now	it's really time	to	potty	train.'

Your	child	is	going	to	do	a	toddler	version	of	'WTF?	I've	got	this	down.	I'm doing what she asked.' In switching approaches, you've just added a complicated	 additional	 step	 to	 the	 whole	 process.	 As	 a	 result,	 you	 have	 to reteach	the	concept	of	what	potty	training	means.	Do	you	see?

I	 think	a	lot	of	parents	expect	that	the	child	will	realize	naturally	that	one day,	 he's	 going	 to	 go	 pee	 and	 poop	 on	 the	 toilet,	 but	 in	 reality,	 that's	 a	 big conceptual	 leap	 to	 expect	 from	 a	 toddler.	 Why	 would	 your	 child	 make	 that assumption	when	all	he's	known	since	birth	is	a	diaper?

The	whole	casual	approach	makes	me	cringe.	I'd	say	a	good	80	percent	of	my current	clients	are	parents	who	took	this	approach	and	now	have	an	older	child in	diapers.	Then	they	have	to	call	me	in.	It	is	not	easy	to	potty	train	four-and five-year-olds-trust	 me.	 I'm	 not	 judging	 at	 all,	 but	 IT'S	 JUST	 SO	 MUCH EASIER	 WHEN	 YOU	 POTTY	 TRAIN	 AT	 THE	 APPROPRIATE	 TIME! Heavy	on	the	capitals,	I	know,	but	I	feel	that	strongly	about	this.

Most	children	between	eighteen	and	twenty-four	months	begin	to	show	an interest	 in	 the	 toilet.	 Often	 this	 has	 more	 to	 do	 with	 the	 toilet	 itself,	 the bathroom,	and	the	spinning	toilet	paper	than	it	does	with	a	bodily	function.	It's also	an	interest	in	mimicking	Mom	and	Dad.	This	interest	doesn't	necessarily signal	any	readiness	to	potty	train;	I	always	look	for	other	markers.	This	brings us	the	next	big	issue	in	potty	training.

CHAPTER	2

## When	to	Start

L et	me	state	this	simply: when	is	almost	more	important	than	how. Unequivocally, potty	 training	 is	 easiest	 when	 done	 between	 the	 ages	 of	 twenty	 and	 thirty months.	 It	 certainly	 can	 be	 done	 earlier	 or	 later,	 with	 caveats.	 For	 instance, most	children	younger	than	twenty	months	won't	connect	the	dots	as	quickly	as older	 kids	 do,	 which	 means	 you'll	 need	 to	 be	 more	 responsible	 for	 acting	 on their	cues	(as	opposed	to	expecting	them	to	act	on	their	own)	than	you	would be	if	they	were	older.

However,	 before	 twenty	 months	 is	 unbelievably	 easier	 than	 after	 thirty months.	Kids	over	thirty	months	are	that	much	more	sophisticated	and	skilled at	manipulation.	They	know	the	power	of	choice	and	free	will.	My	mom	likes	to say,	 'You	 want	 to	 do	 it	 before	 they	 know	 they	 have	 a	 choice	 in	 the	 matter.' Anyone	with	a	three-year-old	can	tell	you	they	are	very	adept	at	exerting	their will.	Your	power	struggles	will	be	huge.	And	guess	what?	You	won't	win.

Smack-dab	in	the	middle	of	that	twenty-to	thirty-month-age	range	is	best	for most	people.	Right	around	twenty-four	months	is	ideal.	At	this	age,	your	child	is eager	to	please,	is	connecting	a	lot	of	the	dots	in	the	big	world	around	him,	is still	malleable,	and	is	dying	for	more	responsibility.	Think	about	it.	Kids	at	this age	love	helping	and	feeling	important.	They	want	to	help	cook	and	clean	and do	chores	around	the	house-it's	the	perfect	time	to	hand	them	their	very	own responsibility.	 You	 want	 to	 take	 advantage	 of	 this	 eager-to-please	 phase.	 It's natural	and	it's	good	and,	unfortunately,	it	will	go	away.	Trust	me.

Mind	you,	there	are	always	going	to	be	exceptions.	More	recently,	I've	seen an	 increase	 in	 moms	 who	 know	 their	 kids	 are	 very	 capable	 of	 potty	 training before	 twenty	 months.	 And	 of	 course,	 there	 are	 plenty	 of	 children	 who	 potty train just fine in the thirty-to thirty-six-month age range. Still, in my experience,	this	age	range	is	when	things	start	getting	tricky.	And	in	case	you didn't	 get	 my	 memo,	 waiting	 until	 after	 three	 is	 going	 to	 bring	 you	 struggles.

We'll	deal	with	the	specific	issues	associated	with	younger	and	older	kids	in	the later	chapters.

## Why	this	time	frame?

- 1.	There	are	certain	'windows	of	opportunity'	in	development,	during	which	a	developmental	task can	be	accomplished	with	the	least	amount	of	conscious	effort	on	the	part	of	the	child.	There	are many	such	windows	of	opportunity	during	childhood.	For	example,	weaning.	Many	kids	wean	at twelve	months,	because	it's	 usually	 very	 easy	 to	 do	 at	 that	 particular	 age.	 Four	 months,	 twelve months,	twenty-four	months,	and	thirty	months	are	documented	windows	of	opportunity	for	easy weaning.	Can	it	be	done	at	other	times?	Sure,	it	just	requires	a	little	more	effort	on	the	part	of both	 mother	 and	 child.	 Similarly,	 there's	 a	 window	 of	 opportunity	 for	 learning	 a	 language. Researchers	and	parents	alike	know	how	effortlessly	a	child	picks	up	a	second	language	before	the age	of	five.	The	same	is	true	for	learning	a	first	language.	I	once	worked	with	a	child	who	had	been secluded	 in	 a	 studio	 apartment	 for	 all	 of	 her	 five	 years	 of	 life	 with	 her	 drug-addicted	 mother. Because	of	her	limited	social	exposure,	she	missed	the	window	of	opportunity	to	learn	her	first language,	English.	To	this	day,	she	requires	major	speech	therapy	and	struggles	in	school.	If	you want	to	potty	train	with	the	least	amount	of	effort,	the	window	of	opportunity	is	between	twenty and	thirty	months.	It's	just	easier,	that's	all.

This	period	of	time	is	also	a	developmental	window	during	which	there	appears	to	be	almost	a lull	 in	 learning	 new	 skills.	 You	 child	 has	 probably	 learned	 the	 basics,	 like	 eating,	 walking,	 and working	through	separation	anxiety.	During	this	period,	he	is	really	just	honing	his	skills.	Nothing too	momentous	is	being	'worked	out'	developmentally	during	this	time.	Note	that	windows	are relative	to	one	another,	though,	so	if	your	child	has	had	delays	in	other	big	milestones,	he	will naturally	be	a	bit	delayed	in	potty	training.

- 2.	Teaching	a	child	to	use	the	potty	imparts	her	with	dignity	and	self-respect.	At	this	age,	your	child is	learning	at	the	speed	of	light.	You're	probably	amazed	and	amused	by	what	she	is	now	capable of. Capable	of .	Do	not	underestimate	what	your	child	is	capable	of.	I	see	tons	of	parents	gleefully showing	off	their	child's	genius,	while	that	same	kid	is	sitting	in	her	own	poop.	That's	not	right. It's	insulting	to	your	child's	intelligence	to	think	she	can't	learn	this	new	skill.
- 3.	For	several	reasons,	if	you	wait	too	long	after	thirty	months,	the	process	of	potty	training	becomes a	chore	for	you	as	well	as	for	your	child.	There	will	be	fights	and	power	struggles,	and	things	will get	ugly	fast.	It	will	take	soooo	much	longer.	In	my	experience,	if	your	child	isn't	fully	trained	by four,	the	likelihood	of	a	child	being	a	bed	wetter	are	increased	by	50	percent.	You	want	to	try	on low	self-esteem?	Try	going	to	your	first	sleepover	and	wetting	the	bed.
- 4.	 Also,	 as	 I've	 mentioned,	 after	 thirty	 months	 your	 child	 will	 be	 well	 into	 the	 process	 of individualization,	that	psychological	process	in	which	your	child	learns	that	he	is	his	own	person and	that	he	is	separate	and	distinct	from	you.	This	process	is	marked	by	defiance	and	resistance	as he	learns	to	express	his	free	will.	This	process	is	normal,	but	things	get	ugly	if	you	wait	until	then to	potty	train.	There	will	be	a	power	struggle	and	for	the	first	time	ever,	your	child	will	literally	be holding	all	the	power,	in	the	form	of	pee	and	poop.	You	will	not	win.
- 5.	 This	 ideal	 potty	 training	 time	 frame	 is	 usually	 accompanied	 by	 other	 markers,	 which	I	look	for even	before	I	look	at	age:
- •	Does	your	child	retreat	to	a	corner	or	private	place	to	poop?
- •	Can	your	child	recite	the	'ABC'	song?
- ·	Can	your	child communicate his	needs?	By	this	I	mean:
- Can	your	child	somehow	ask	for	water,	juice,	or	milk	when	he's	thirsty?
- Can	your	child	somehow	ask	for	a	snack	when	he's	hungry?
- Can	your	child	throw	a	tantrum	for	candy	at	the	market?
- Can	your	child	throw	a	tantrum	for	just	about anything ?

If	your	child	is	retreating	to	some	private	place-any	place:	under	the	table, another	room,	maybe	even	just	turning	his	back-to	poop,	it	is absolutely time	to start	 potty	 training.	 This	 means	 your	 child	 is	 equating	 pooping	 with	 privacy, which is a natural and correct progression. Your child is showing embarrassment.	To	be	clear,	these	bodily	functions	are	normal,	and	you	should not	embarrass	your	child	about	them.	However,	with	socialization	comes	a	sense of	shame	in	performing	bodily	functions	in	front	of	others.	If	you	were	sitting	in my	class	and	pooped	in	your	pants,	you'd	be	embarrassed.	I'm	warning	you-if you	 don't	 recognize	 this	 sign	 of	 readiness	 and	 act	 on	 it,	 your	 child	 will	 soon forget	to	be	embarrassed.	When	this	happens,	you	end	up	with	a	five-year-old who's	not	bothered	at	all	by	pooping	in	his	pants.

In	my	experience,	the	'ABC'	song	is	a	rough-but	by	no	means	definitivegauge	of	where	your	child	is	developmentally.	Kids	who	can	recite	the	song	have learned	some	language	and,	most	likely,	they've	learned	it	through	repetition. So	maybe	your	kid	isn't	busting	out	with	full	paragraphs	of	speech.	If	he	can	say his	ABCs,	he's	probably	ready.	Again,	I'm	just	going	by	my	own	experience;	I've just	seen	a	correlation	between	the	ability	to	recite	this	song	and	ease	of	potty training.

Tantrums	are	due	to	your	child wanting something-anything-and	you	not giving	it.	If	your	child	is	aware	of	thirst,	hunger,	and	desires	(wants),	and	can	act on	 those	 awarenesses,	 then	 your	 child	 is	 perfectly	 capable	 of	 regulating	 her bodily	functions;	your	child	is	ready	to	be	potty	trained.

Just	in	case	I	haven't	beaten	you	over	the	head	enough	with	this	time	frame, I'll	 reiterate.	 Between	 twenty	 and	 thirty	 months	 is	 the	 perfect	 time	 to	 potty train.	Trust	me.	It's	almost	freaky	how	much	resistance	you	will	encounter	if	you attempt	to	potty	train	after	thirty	months.

Now,	let's	say	your	child	has	all	of	the	markers	I've	been	talking	about,	and you're	 just	 not	 convinced	 of	 his	 readiness.	 Or	 you	 are	 wildly	 unsure.	 Or	 you don't	want	to	eff	this	up.	Or	everyone	but	everyone	is	telling	you	that	twentyfour	months	is	too	early	to	potty	train.

I	CANNOT	STRESS	THIS	ENOUGH:	if	you	are	attempting	to	potty	train and	you	have	major	doubts,	it	will	NOT	go	well	for	you.	I	have	seen	it	time	and time	and	time	again.	YOU	MUST	BELIEVE	YOU	ARE	DOING	THE	RIGHT THING.	You	must	know	that	your	child	is	capable	of	this.	It's	okay	to	be	a	little unsure,	but	you	must	be	determined.	If	you	are	in	two	camps-sure	and	unsure -your	child	will	be,	too.	It	will	look	like	a	hot	mess.	I	have	no	other	words	to explain	 this	 phenomenon	 by	 which	 your	 kid	 picks	 up	 on	 your	 attitude	 other than	woo-woo	words,	like	'vibe'	and	'energy.'	If	your	mind	isn't	made	up,	your child	 will	 pick	 up	 on	 it	 and	 mirror	 being	 sure	 and	 unsure.	 Whenever	 I	 get	 a client	whose	situation	suggests	a	lack	of	determination,	I	usually	start	with	the 'Are	 you	 sure	 you	 are	 committed?'	 speech.	 My	 blog	 is	 peppered	 with	 the importance	of	determination	and	we'll	discuss	it	more	in	later	chapters.	I	used the	word vibe earlier	because	I'm	all	airy-fairy,	but	if	you're	not,	nonverbal	cues work,	too.

Nonverbal	cues	can	be	easier	understood	if	you've	ever	been	around	animals. Especially	dogs.	I	used	to	not	be	a	dog	person.	Since	we	got	a	dog,	I'm	a total dog person.	And	since	I	have	a	dog	and	five-year-old,	I	can't	help	but	notice	many similarities	between	these	two	small	beings.	It	didn't	take	me	long	to	figure	out how	 much	 information	 our	 dog	 receives	 from nonverbal	 cues .	 This	 dog	 (and while	I	love	her,	I	don't	think	she's	special	in	this	respect)	knows	the	different sounds	my	pots	and	pans	make	and	which	one	is	most	likely	to	yield	a	snack. She	knows	that	when	my	coffee	starts	brewing,	it's	time	to	wake	up	and	pee.	But mostly	 she	 senses	 excitement,	 anticipation,	 and	 fear	 in me .	 And	 she	 reacts accordingly.

A	few	weeks	back,	we	were	going	on	a	road	trip	to	see	my	best	friend.	Stella (the	dog)	was	coming	with	us,	but	she	didn't	seem	to	get	that.	That	morning, the	 packing,	 the	 anticipation,	 the	 energy	 of	 going	 on	 a	 trip	 was	 driving	 her bananas .	She	was	under	foot	and	whining.	I	finally	put	her	in	the	car	to	wait	for us	and	she	settled	right	down. She	knew	something	was	happening	and	she	wasn't sure	 what. Once	 in	 the	 car,	 she	 was	 okay.	 Like,	 'I'm	 going	 with	 them.	 Okay. Cool.'

OUR	CHILDREN	ARE	NO	DIFFERENT.	They	are	just	figuring	out	the	big world	around	them.	They	are	sensitive	and	on	high	alert	for	new	information, largely	from	nonverbal	cues.	They	are	watching,	listening,	and,	more	important, sensing what	it	is	we	are	feeling.	And	they	are	going	to	react	accordingly.

I	think	most	people	don't	even	realize	how	sensitive	our	children	are	because we talk to	 them	 and	 assume	 that	 they	 understand.	 So	 even	 if	 we	 are	 shaking with	 fear,	 we	 assume	 that	 we	 can	 talk	 our	 way	 out	 of	 it.	 But	 with	 little	 kids, that's	 not	 true.	 They	 pick	 up	 that	 vibe	 way	 more	 than	 they	 pick	 up	 on	 the words.

I've	seen	the	mere	mention	of	potty	training	drain	the	color	from	a	parent's face,	 send	 waves	 of	 panic	 through	 her	 body,	 and	 set	 off	 the	 craziest	 thread	 of comments	 on	 Facebook.	 So	 many	 parents	 jump	 into	 the	 first	 day	 of	 potty training	with	that	very	same	vibe:	one	of	panic,	dread,	and	fear.	And	then	they can't	 figure	 out	 why	 their	 child	 is	 resisting	 or	 kicking	 up	 dirt.	 Why	 on	 earth would	a	child	want	to	do	something	that's	got	Mom	so	wound	up?

Imagine	 going	 to	 your	 child's	 first	 dental	 visit	 with	 that	 panic	 and	 dread. Yikes.	Good	luck	with	that.

So	how	do	you	fix	it?	How	do	you	stay	calm	and	trust	your	gut?

You	think	of	this	as	a	developmental	milestone-which	it	is-not	a	potential war.	You	know	in	your	heart	when	your	child	is	capable	of	doing	this.	You	don't post	 on	 Facebook	 when	 you	 are	 ready	 to	 start	 and	 get	 sixty-four	 varying opinions.	You	realize	your	child	is	an	individual	and	will	have	his	own	learning curve.	 You	 recognize	 that	 he	 may	 not	 do	 this	 just	 like	 your	 best	 friend's	 kids. And	you	realize	this	is	not	a	measurement	of	your	parenting.	It's	just	something you	are	teaching	your	child.

Panic,	fear,	and	dread	will	only	put	more	difficulties	in	your	path.	Relaxed	is key.

Since	the	original	writing	of	this	book,	more	and	more	parents	are	choosing to	 begin	 potty	 training	 between	 eighteen	 and	 twenty-two	 months.	 This	 was actually	 the	 expected	 time	 to	 potty	 train	 a	 generation	 ago.	 Modern	 moms training	 during	 this	 period	 are	 having	 huge	 success,	 because	 the	 potty	 just becomes	another	thing	the	child	is	learning;	it's	not	wrapped	up	in	any	other drama,	like	the	drama	of	being	two.	I	will	specifically	address	kids	under	twenty months	and	over	thirty	months	in	chapter	15,	'Younger	Than	Twenty	Months, Older	Than	Three	Years.'

For	 now,	 let's	 bust	 up	 some	 myths	 and	 misconceptions	 that	 might	 be blocking	your	path	to	easy	potty	training.

CHAPTER	3

## Myths	and	Misconceptions

O kay,	so	we're	clear	on	when	to	potty	train.	Now	I'd	like	to	talk	about	some common	myths	and	misconceptions-some	widely	 held	 beliefs	 you	 may	 have heard	 or	 read.	 Some	 are	 so	 common,	 they've	 almost	 become	 law.	 They've infiltrated	day	cares,	playgrounds,	and	community	centers.	Some	are	convenient sound	bites	that	I	often	read	or	hear	about.	I'm	going	to	deconstruct	them	here, so	we	can	get	logical	about	all	of	this.

Warning:	You	may	need	to	use	some	common	sense	here,	so	be	prepared.

Take	a	moment	to	think	about	whether	these	statements	are	true	or	false:

- 1.	It's	best	to	wait	until	your	child	gives	you	signals.
- 2.	Boys	are	harder	to	train	than	girls	are.
- 3.	It's	easier	to	train	for	pee	first,	then	tackle	poop.
- 4.	You	should	put	the	potty	chair	out	before	you	start	training	so	your	child	can	get	used	to	it.

## Myths

Myth	1: It's	best	to	wait	until	your	child	gives	you	signals.

False. We've	sort	of	covered	the	idea	of	'waiting	till	they're	ready,'	but	let's	give it	some	more	thought.	What	does	a	parent	mean	by,	'I'm	going	to	wait	till	he gives	me	signals	that	he's	ready'?	What	signals?	Some	not-yet-potty-trained	kids start	 staying	 dry	 during	 naps,	 or	 wake	 up	 dry	 in	 the	 morning,	 but	 not	 usually. Some	kids	show	an	interest	in	the	toilet,	but	others	don't	ever	show	an	interest. Are	 you	 waiting	 for	 your	 child	 to	 wave	 a	 flag	 that	 says,	 'I	 have	 to	 pee'? Remember,	all	your	child	has	known	is	a	diaper.	What	signal	could	they	possibly give	when	they	don't	know	what	it	is	they	should	be	signaling?	Just	think	about it.	 How	do	you	signal	for	a	brand-new	action?	Once	potty	training	has	begun, sure,	your	child	will	have	signals.	For	instance,	she	might	do	a	pee-pee	dance. This	could	be	the	classic	hopping	from	foot	to	foot.	Other	'dances'	or	signals could	include	staying	completely	still.	You	might	notice	that	she	looks	antsy	or twitchy.	Regardless	of	your	individual	child's	signals	that	she	has	to	pee,	they develop	once	you've begun potty	training,	not	before.	To	wait	for	a	signal	from your	child	that	he	is	ready	to	begin	potty	training	is	inviting	trouble.

## Myth	2: Boys	are	harder	to	train	than	girls	are.

Really	false. This	one	ticks	me	off.	A	lot.	Mostly	because	so	many	people	buy this	 crap.	 Close	 your	 eyes	 and	 give	 this	 some serious thought.	 Why	 on	 earth would	 this	 be	 true?	 Some	 people	 in	 my	 class	 have	 suggested	 it's	 because	 girls supposedly	 mature	 faster	 than	 boys.	 Perhaps	 this	 is	 true,	 but	 it	 becomes significant	much	later,	like	during	the	preteen	years.	Not	so	much	at	two.	When I	see	a	group	of	two-year-olds,	they	all	seem	on	pretty	even	ground.	It's	all	pretty much	'don't	hit	and	please	share.'	If	anything,	I	think	boys	are easier to	 train than	girls.	They	can	pretty	much	pee	anywhere.	He's	got	to	go	in	the	parking lot?	 Just	 pull	 down	 the	 pants	 and	 pee	 on	 the	 tires.	 And	 this	 is	 just	 my	 own personal	 observation,	 but	 because	 a	 boy's	 equipment	 is	 outside	 and	 a	 girl's	 is neatly	 tucked	 away,	 I	 think	 boys	 do	 a	 much	 more	 prominent	 pee-pee	 dance. And	mostly	I	refuse	to	believe	that	at	this	age,	my	son	is	not	as	smart	as	some girl!	 Use	 your	 common	sense	and	intuition	here.	Boys	are	not	harder	to	train than	 girls.	 There	 are	 some	 differences	 between	 the	 genders,	 but	 'different' doesn't	mean	'harder.'

Myth	3: It's	easier	to	train	for	pee	first,	then	tackle	poop.

This	is	absolutely	false. I've	heard	this	before,	but	I	don't	even	know	how	you'd approach	training	this	way-put	a	diaper	on	for	poop,	or	what?	This	is	one	of the	oddest	myths	out	there,	but	it is out	there,	so	I'm	addressing	it.	Your	child will	very	easily	identify	both	pee	and	poop	as	bodily	functions	that	need	to	go	in the	 pot,	 even	 though	 the	 sensations	 accompanying	 them	 come	 from	 two different	places.	This	is	not	to	say	that	parents	and	children	don't	often	have	a difficult	time	with	poop.	Poop	actually	has	its	very	own	chapter.	And	I	might point	out	that	it's	the	longest	chapter	in	the	book.	It's	a	big	frigging	deal	that's recently	gotten	bigger.

For	now,	just	remember	your	child	has	only	known	squishy	poop	against	his butt.	It	sounds	gross,	but	it's	a	sensation	he	knows	and	is	comfortable	with.	And kids'	 little	 bodies	 generally	 produce	 an	 absurd	 amount	 of	 poop,	 usually	 quite effortlessly.	 The	 sensation	 of	 poop	 just	 sliding	 out	 and	 not	 hanging	 around	 is brand-new	and	somewhat	scary.

In	general,	we	are	a	culture	that	disdains	the	very	important	bodily	function of	 pooping,	 and	 that's	 what	 our	 kids	 learn.	 Given	 that,	 is	 it	 any	 wonder	 that some	kids	don't	want	to	poop?	Look	at	how	you	act	about	poop,	both	your	own and	your	child's.	You	have	to	make	this	a	very	normal,	important	function	for your	child.	From	the	time	you	are	done	reading	this	book	until	you	begin	potty training,	you	should	be	letting	your	child	come	with	you	to	pee	and	poop.	It's very	important	to	have	your	child	see	that	pooping	is	normal,	it	doesn't	hurt, and	its	existence	doesn't	have	to	be	veiled	in	secrecy.	I	highly	suggest	that	if	you or	 your	 partner	 is	 a New	 York	 Times kind	 of	 person,	 get	 things	 rolling	 by bringing	your	child	with	you.	Have	them	sit	on	the	floor	and	read,	or	you	can read	to	them.	Does	that	sound	freaky	to	you?	If	it	does,	it's	a	good	indicator	that your	poop	values	are	a	little	more	stringent	than	you	thought.	Loosen	up	.	.	.	it will	help	your	child.

All	the	time,	I'll	 hear	 parents	 say	 something	 like,	 'Oh!	 We	 are	 total	 poop people.	Very	comfortable	with	it.	Yup.	No	issues	here.'	And	then	their	kid	has	a hard	time	with	poop.	When	I	suggest	they	take	their	kid	with	them	to	poop, they	freak	out	about	how	weird	and	gross	that	is.	If	this	is	weird	and	gross	to	you, that	attitude	will	be	conveyed	to	your	child.

In	any	event,	we'll	hit	it	all	in	chapter	10,	'Poop.'	Betcha	can't	wait,	huh?

Myth	4 (and	I	saved	the	best	for	last!):	You	should	put	the	potty	chair	out	before	you start	training	so	your	child	can	get	used	to	it.

So	false	my	head	might	blow	off. I'm	sure	you've	at	least	heard	this,	if	you're not	in	fact	already	doing	it.	I	applaud	you	for	not	sneaking	up	on	your	child	and freaking	them	out,	but	please	read	on	with	a	dash	of	common	sense.	The	small potty	chair	was	invented	to	be	a	less	scary	version	of	the	big	porcelain	bowl.	The toilet is indeed	 scary to a little kid. The	 size is scary, the flushing is overwhelming,	 and	 your	 child's	 butt	 is	 way	 too	 small	 for	 the	 seat.	 So	 some brilliant	person	invented	a	small	pot	that	is	just	right!

Now	I	want	to	ask	you	a	couple	of	questions.	First,	look	around	your	house and	 pay	 close	 attention	 to	 baby	 items:	 highchair,	 stroller,	 bouncy	 chair,	 and talking	toys.	I'm	willing	to	bet	that	the	small	potty	chair	is	the	most	innocuous piece	of	plastic	in	your	house!	Did	you	put	the	highchair	out	for	your	child	to get	used	to	it?	No,	you	probably	put	it	together	and	put	her	in	it	and	took	your first	shower	in	weeks.	Did	you	put	your	child	in	the	highchair	to	'practice'?	No, you	probably	put	him	in	it	to	eat.	And	when	he	was	done	eating,	you	probably took	him	right	out.	Did	you	leave	your	stroller	in	the	middle	of	the	living	room so	she	could	get	used	to	it?	No,	you	strapped	her	in	and	went	for	a	walk.	Think about	it!

Now	another	question.	Would	you	let	your	child	play	around	your	toilet	and bathroom	to	get	used	to	it?	Would	you	let	your	child	throw	things	in	the	toilet? No,	 it's	 for	 one	 purpose	 only:	 pooping	 and	 peeing.	 We	 usually	 don't	 use containers	for	fecal	matter	for	any	other	purpose.

Putting	 a	 potty	 chair	 out	 for	 your	 child	 to	 get	 used	 to	 it	 is	 useless	 and counterproductive.	If	you	have	already	done	this,	you	probably	know	that	the chair	 has	 become	 a	 basketball	 net,	 a	 stroller,	 a	 hat,	 art	 supply	 storage,	 a Matchbox	car	garage,	a	step	stool,	and	a	doll	pool. Your	child	does	not	need	to	get used	to	the	potty. Putting	it	out	ahead	of	actual	potty	training	will	only	serve	to lessen	its	magic.	It's	for	one	special	purpose	and	that	purpose	only.

If	 you	 have	 been	 doing	 this,	 no	 worries.	 I'll	 tell	 you	 how	 to	 remedy	 the situation	in	chapter	5,	'Ditch	the	Diapers!	The	How-To.'

When	 I	 start	 a	 class,	 I	 like	 to	 ask	 everyone	 where	 they	 are	 in	 the	 potty training	process.	Most	often	I	hear	this:	'Well,	we	put	the	potty	chair	out	so	he could	get	used	to	it.	He	sometimes	sits	on	it.	Sometimes	he	asks	to	go,	but	not with	any	regularity.	Yesterday,	he	asked	to	sit	on	it	in	the	morning,	but	that	was

- it.	 When	 he's	 naked,	 he	 usually	 sits	 on	 it,	 but	 when	 he's	 dressed,	 he	 doesn't usually	 want	 to.	 So	 yeah,	 I	 guess	 he's	 kind	 of	 potty	 trained.'	 Most	 of	 these parents	report	this	as	success.	Sound	at	all	familiar?

## 'Kind	of	potty	trained'	is	like	'kind	of	pregnant.'

One	pee	on	the	pot	in	the	morning	is	not	potty	trained.	Using	the	pot	while naked,	at	home,	is	not	potty	trained.	I	have	to	be	honest	here,	and	you	may	not like	 this:	 most	 of	 the	 parents	 I've	 worked	 with	 who	 put	 the	 pot	 out	 for	 their child	to	get	used	to	it	are	really	putting	it	out	to	see	if	she	will	up	and	decide	to potty	train	herself.	They	harbor	this	secret	fantasy	that	once	the	potty	is	out, their	child	will	use	it	correctly.	They	haven't	yet	really	committed	to	the	process of	potty	training.

Once	again,	using	the	potty	is	a	skill	that	must	be	learned,	just	like	any	other skill	your	child	has	learned.	I'll	repeat	what	I	said	in	chapter	1:	children	learn	by repetition.	Therefore,	if	you	put	the	pot	out,	you	should	be	ready	to	teach	your child	consistently	to	use	it.

I	see	all	kinds	of	mixed	messages	and	lack	of	consistency	in	parents	'trying' to	potty	train.

I'll	quote	Yoda	for	the	gratuitous Star	Wars reference:	'Do	or	do	not.	There	is no	try.'	Direct	quote	from	the	wise	green	guy.

This	goes	right	along	with	my	theory	of	'kinda	potty	training.'	Or	'trying'	to potty	train.	You	either	are	potty	training	or	you	are	not.	Trying	does	not	enter the	equation.	If	you	are	'trying,'	you	are	giving	yourself	an	out.	I	often	think about	 it	 in	 terms	 of	 smoking.	 A	 smoker	 trying	 to	 quit	 is	 still	 a	 smoker.	 They allow	themselves	to	smoke	in	a	moment	of	stress	or	when	it	gets	too	hard.	A smoker	who	quits	no	longer	smokes,	regardless	of	the	situation	 he	 might	 find himself	in.

Are	 you	 'trying'	 to	 potty	 train	 in	 order	 to	 give	 yourself	 an	 out?	 Why? Convenience?	Or	fear	of	failing?	Not	doing	it	right?

Have	confidence	in	yourself	and	have	faith	in	your	kid.	You	both	can	do	this, quickly,	gently,	and	effectively.

Do	or	do	not.	There	is	no	trying.

When	you	are	'trying'	to	potty	train,	it	often	looks	like	this:	You	ask	your child	 to	 pee	 on	 the	 potty,	 yet	 you	 turn	 around	 and	 put	 a	 diaper	 on	 him	 if	 it better	suits	the	needs	of	your	day.	You	ask	your	child	to	tell	you	when	he	has	to pee	but	ask	him	to	wait	a	minute	while	you	finish	whatever	it	is	you're	doing. You	 put	 the	 potty	 out	 so	 he	 can	 use	 it,	 but	 you	 don't	 teach	 him	 to	 use	 it consistently.	Then	the	day	comes,	after	months	of	'trying,'	when	you've	had	it and	get	serious.	Now	you	say,	'I	mean	it.'	But	your	child	has	already	learned that	you	don't.

So	no,	don't	put	the	potty	out	for	your	child	to	get	used	to	it.	Put	it	out	when you	mean	business.	That	is,	you	mean	your	child	to	put	his	business	in	it.

## Common	Misconceptions	(or,	Common	Sound	Bites)

These	are	a	couple	of	common	misconceptions	that	I	hear	in	neat	little	sound bites	that	warrant	enough	concern	to	discuss.	They	may	or	may	not	be	on	your worry	list.

## Sound	Bite	1: 'But	I	don't	want	to	push	him.'

This	 is	 probably	 the	 second-most-used	 sound	 bite	 in	 potty	 training,	 surpassed only	by,	'wait	till	he's	ready.'	First,	we	need	to	examine	where	this	phrase	came from,	and	then	we'll	look	at	what	it's	become	in	modern	parenting.

Not	 pushing	 a	 child	 to	 potty	 train,	 much	 like	 waiting	 for	 the	 child	 to	 be ready,	started	as	a	reaction	to	common	potty	training	techniques	in	the	1940s, when	children	 were	 strapped	 down	 to	 potty	 chairs	 at	 around	 nine	 months	 of age.	 They	 were	 given	 soap	 suppositories	 to	 produce	 poop.	 They	 were	 often abused	for	accidents	or	left	for	hours	to	sit	in	their	excrement.	Just	to	be	clear, that is	pushing	a	child.	And	yes,	it	was	horrible	and	abusive.

Then	came	Dr.	Spock	and	a	new	wave	of	thought	about	child	psychology, which	introduced	the	notion	that	children	are	actually	little	humans	with	the capacity	not	only	to	feel	pain,	but	to	grow	up	with	that	pain	into	maladjusted big humans.	 The	 next	 fifty years gave slow birth to modern	 parenting philosophies,	including	the	recent	rise	of	attachment	parenting	(which	isn't	a new	concept	at	all,	actually).	And	so	the	pendulum	began	to	swing.	I	believe that	 at	 present,	 we	 have	 swung	 about	 as	 far	 as	 possible	 from	 the	 parenting philosophies	of	the	1940s.

Thanks	to	stupid,	jerk Time magazine	and	the	infamous	breast-feeding	cover (April	2012),	some	modern	parenting	practices	and	philosophies	have	peaked	in bitter	controversy.	Personally,	I	followed	the	tenets	of	the	modern	incarnation of	 attachment	 parenting,	 mostly	 during	 my	 son's	 first	 year.	 That	 is	 to	 say,	 I 'wore'	 him	 in	 a	 baby	 carrier	 almost	 constantly,	 breast-fed	 on	 demand,	 and coslept.	 Then	 I	 stopped	 reading	 books	 and	 paying	 attention	 to	 'rules,'	 and started	to	wing	it	based	on	what	felt	right.	An	excellent	resource,	which	I'm	not even	sure	uses	the	term	'attachment	parenting,'	is The	Continuum	Concept by Jean	 Liedloff.	 The	 major	 point	 I	 took	 away	 from	 this	 book	 is	 that	 children should	be	at	the	center	of	everyday	life,	so	they	know	their	place	in	the	world. In	 this	 way,	 they	 learn	 that	 they	 are	 one	 of	 a	 whole,	 be	 it	 a	 family	 or	 a community,	and	they	learn	about	the	goings-on	in	daily	life.

Through	 my	 work	 as	 a	 potty	 trainer,	 I	 see	 that	 things	 have	 gotten	 out	 of balance	in	many	current	parenting	trends.	In	many	cases,	the	child	has become the	 center,	 rather	 than	 being in the	 center.	 The	 child	 gets	 all	 the	 focus	 and, often,	 gets	 a	 case	 of	 terminal	 specialness.	 What's	 also	 happened,	 as	 I	 talked about	in	chapter	1,	is	that	we	have	somehow	come	to	think	that	children	can make	their	own	decisions	regarding	what's	best	for	them	long	term.

Now,	you	may	find	yourself	bristling	against	me	here,	and	that's	okay.	But	I want	to	reiterate	 the	 point	 that	 every	 child	 needs	 to	 be	 nudged	 to	 learn	 new things.	 We	 are	 humans,	 and	 humans	 like	 to	 be	 good	 at	 what	 we	 attempt. Psychologists	have	found	that	blindly	praising	a	child	can	actually	limit	them into	doing	only	that	at	which	they	excel.	We	don't	like	to	suck	at	things.	As	a result,	 humans-all	 humans,	 little	 or	 big-will	 stick	 to	 the	 status	 quo,	 simply because	learning	something	means	temporarily	sucking	at	it.

We	as	parents	are	responsible	for	teaching	our	children	and	nudging	them along	in	their	learning.	And	check	this	out:	if	everything	is	hunky-dory	in	your kid's	life,	what	motivation	does	he	have	to	change?	Why	would	potty	training be	preferable	to	diaper	wearing?	Think	about	that	from	the	child's	perspective. To	him,	 there's	 no	 benefit.	 You	 are	 currently	 doing	 all	 the	 work.	 He	 doesn't need	to	think	or	stop	what	he's	doing.	You	clean	up	the	mess.	The	status	quo	is pretty	darn	good	for	him,	so	why	change?	The	nudge	to	change	comes	from	you, because-much	 like	 anything	 that	 requires	 learning	 and	 practice-we	 know he'll	be	better	off	for	it	on	the	other	side.

Regardless	of	your	parenting	philosophy,	I	understand	not	wanting	to	push your	 child.	 However,	 nudging	 things	 along	 is	 NOT	 pushing.	 Pushing	 doesn't have	 to	 be	 abusive.	 Pushing	 can	 be	 you,	 the	 parent,	 following	 through	 when your	child	might	not	want	to.	Piano	practice	and	homework	are	two	big	things we,	as	parents,	have	to	push.	And	you	don't	have	to	be	all	tiger-mom	about	it; we're	looking	for	the	pendulum	to	stop	somewhere	in	the	middle.

I	also	remember	teaching	my	son	to	ski.	I	had	to	do	a	lot	of	nudging	past	my son's	fear	that	day,	because	I	knew	he	was	capable,	and	I	wasn't	packing	it	in	to get	off	the	mountain	and	go	home.	I	didn't	'force'	him,	but	I	nudged	him. A	lot. He	got	frustrated	and	upset	with	me	and	I	got	frustrated	and	upset	with	him. And	we	both	cried	but,	dammit,	I	wasn't	going	to	leave	the	mountain.	So	I	took what	 I	 know	 about	 him	 and	 relaxed	 about	 my	 expectations,	 and	 we	 did	 it together.	And	now	he	loves	skiing.

Overcoming	these	doubts	and	fears,	 both	 yours	 and	 your	 child's,	 is	 part	 of parenting.	I	could	have	left	the	mountain,	of	course.	But	he learned something that	 day,	 something	 that	 made	 him shine .	 Isn't	 learning	 something	 new	 often filled	with	fear	and	doubt?

And	there's	always	something	amazing	on	the	other	side	of	that.	Always.

There's	 pride	 in	 learning	 something	 new,	 in	 overcoming	 something	 we thought	we	couldn't,	for	both	you	and	your	child.

So,	yes.	Potty	training	will	be	your	complete	focus	for	the	first	week	or	so.	But it	will	be	so	worth	it	when	you	see	the	look	of	pride	on	your	child's	face,	that	he did	 something	 he	 didn't	 know	 how	 to	 do	 last	 week.	 Yes,	 there	 can	 be	 some resistance.	 That	 first	 week	 of	 kindergarten,	 about	 ten	 kids	 kicked	 up	 so	 much resistance	 that	 you	 would	 have	 sworn	 torture	 was	 on	 the	 curriculum.	 I	 mean, they	were	screaming	and	kicking.	Still,	their	parents,	for	various	reasons,	had	to have	them	in	school.	And	you	know	what?	As	soon	as	it	became	clear	that	there really	wasn't	another	option,	the	kids	settled	down	and	now love kindergarten. Once	it	became	the	new	routine,	it	was	just	that:	routine.	But	can	you	imagine if	the	parents	hadn't	'pushed'	the	issue?

We're	going	to	hit	resistance	a	bit	later	in	the	book,	for	sure.	But	for	now,	I don't	want	you	to	think	any	part	of	potty	training	is	pushing	your	child	to	do something	he's	not	capable	of	doing.	No	one	goes	into	potty	training	thinking, I'm	gonna	push	this	to	the	max.	This	kid	is	going	to	potty	train	whether	she	likes	it	or not ,	right?	I	mean,	no	one	does	that.	Well,	not	anyone	who's	bought	this	book anyway.	Those	kind	of	parents	don't	usually	make	up	my	clientele.

However,	I	do	see	this	happen	all	the	time:

'Johnny,	do	you	have	to	go?	Do	you	have	to	pee	now?	Come	on,	let's	go	pee. Please?	Mommy's	going.	Do	you	want	to	come	with	me?	Come	on,	Johnny,	I'm serious	now.	Story	time	is	soon,	and	we	have	to	pee	before	we	leave.	I	know	you have	to	pee,	you	haven't	peed	all	morning.	Come	ON.	I	want	you	to	pee	right now.	Look,	you're	doing	a	little	 dance.	 Come	 on,	 buddy,	 let's	 go	 pee.	 Please? DoyouhavetogoDoyouhavetogoDoyouhavetogo??????'

Nooooo	.	.	.	that's	not	aggressive	at	all.

This	is	from	the	very	parents	who	don't	want	to	'push'	their	children.	I	don't know	about	 you,	 but	 it	 sounds	 awfully	 pushy	 to	 me.	 Most	 people	 don't	 even realize	how	much	pressure	they	are	putting	on	their	child	just	by	bugging	him	to death.	 A	 big	 part	 of	 potty	 training, as I teach	 it, is giving	 your	 child responsibility	and	following	through	with	trust.

## Sound	Bite	2: 'Once	your	child	is	potty	trained,	accidents	won't	happen.'

I	love	this	one.	I	see	it	all	the	time	in	Facebook	comments.	I	see	it	in	blog	posts. I	hear	it	on	the	playground,	usually	accompanied	by	some	sort	of	snide	attitude: 'A	potty	trained	kid	shouldn't	have	accidents.'

When	has	your	child	ever	learned	something	and	then	never	made	a	mistake afterward?	 Ridiculous,	 no?	 To	 think	 that	 your	 child	 would	 never	 have	 an accident	is	weird.	I	wish	there	were	a	magic	'potty	training	switch,'	and	once you	turned	it	on,	it	would	be	on	forever.	Yeah.	Right.

Now,	I	know	that	from	a	logical	perspective,	we	all	realize	this	is	false.	Of course,	accidents	happen.	Still,	I	find	that	in	reality,	parents	don't	really	expect them.	 Most	 don't	 prepare	 for	 it,	 and	 I'd	 say	 90	 percent	 of	 the	 parents	 I	 see expect full potty	training	in	one	or	two	days.	You	may	have	an	all-star	these	first few	days,	but	I	assure	you,	accidents	can	still	happen.

Potty	training	is	a	process.	Your	child	will	get	better	and	better	at	it.	This book	will	get	you	well	on	your	way.	Each	week	will	get	easier	and	easier,	and you'll	focus	less	and	less	on	it.	Accidents	will	happen,	most	often	because	wethe	parents-forget	(or	ignore)	pee-pee	dances,	or	don't	prompt	the	child.	It's important	to	remember	that	accidents	are	just	that;	they're	not	intended.	I	like to	tell	 parents	to	be	prepared.	Look,	you're	carrying	around	a	diaper	bag	right now	anyway.	What's	one	more	month	of	carrying	around	a	change	of	clothes, just	in	case?

I	like	to	say	that	accidents	within	the	first	week	aren't	accidents,	but	rather are	 learning	 tools.	 Both	 you	 and	 your	 child	 are	 still	 figuring	 this	 whole	 thing out.	Of	course,	something's	off	if	your	child	is only ever	having	accidents	and	is not	making	it	to	the	potty	at	all.	We'll	discuss	this	later.

True	'accidents'	are	actually	more	likely	to	happen	a	few	months	into	the process.	This	is	when	knowing	how	to	use	the	potty	has	become	nothing	special. You	no	longer	give	verbal	praise.	You	know	your	child	knows	his	own	signals, and	 you	 assume	 he'll	 tell	 you	 if	 he	 needs	 to	 go.	 That	 aside,	 big	 regressions warrant	big	scrutiny.	Since	I	brought	it	up,	let's	discuss	that	a	little	further.

## Regression

This	 problem	 often	 arises	 when	 parents	 are	 expecting	 another	 child	 and	 fear that	initiating	potty	training	with	their	toddler	will	end	badly,	with	the	child regressing	as	a	newcomer	enters	the	home.	Simply	defined,	regression	is	moving backward.	Children	sometimes	do	regress	when	a	new	sibling	comes	along.	Most often,	 this	 is	 in	 the	 form	 of	 accidents.	 Personally,	 I	 have	 never	 seen	 a	 child regress	 all	 the	 way	 back	 to	 prepotty	 trained.	 Any	 major	 transition-a	 new sibling,	a	move,	a	divorce-can	trigger	regression.	The	regression	is	your	child's way	 of	 'acting	 out'	 his	 feelings	 because	 he's	 too	 young	 to	 articulate	 them	 in words.	Acting	out	is	always	for	attention.	It	saddens	me	when	I	hear	people	say, 'Oh,	she's	just	doing	that	for	attention.'	Well,	then	pay	attention.	I'm	talking	a little	more	seriously	than	your	child	being	a	total	crackpot	for	Grandma.

While	regression	can	be	an	issue,	you	should	not	delay	potty	training	simply because	you	fear	the	possibility	of	a	problem.	First	of	all,	you	may	not	have	one. Second,	with	all	the	work	you're	going	to	have	with,	say,	the	new	baby,	you	at least	want	to	have	laid	the	potty	training	groundwork	beforehand.	Even	if	your toddler	does	regress,	it	is	a	thousand	times	easier	to	get	back	on	track	than	to start	from	the	beginning.

Also,	don't	assume	your	toddler	will	regress	in	the	form	of	accidents.	Some kids	react	to	a	major	change	in	other	ways.	In	the	case	of	a	new	sibling,	they might	act	out	by	hitting	the	new	baby,	biting	you,	or	ignoring	the	newcomer entirely.	 Some	 kids	 will	 have	 no	 reaction	 whatsoever.	 We'll	 discuss	 more specifics	in	chapter	19,	'Random	Tips	and	Questions.'

Those are the biggest myths and misconceptions. Most of them, unfortunately,	 are	 heard	 and	 repeated	 a	 lot.	 When	 you	 really	 think	 them through,	though,	they	have	little	validity.	So	now,	my	friends	.	.	.	on	to	some mental	preparation.

## CHAPTER	4

## Mental	Preparation

T his	chapter	is	all	about	getting	your	head	screwed	on	tight,	so	it	doesn't	blow off-aka	preparation	for	the	big	day!

I	know	you	are	chomping	at	the	bit	for	the	actual	potty	training,	but	making sure	 your	 head	 is	 screwed	 on	 tight	 is	 a	 very	 important	 part	 of	 the	 how-to (actually,	it's	an	important	part	of	parenting,	in	general).

The	very	first	thing	we	have	to	do	is	to	get	rid	of	any	notion	you	might	have of	how	long	this	process	should	take.	I've	already	stated	my	piece	about	magical three-day	training.	Yes,	it	can	take	a	child	three	days	to	potty	train.	It	can	also take	one	day.	And	it	can	also	take	seven.	I	find	it	very	interesting	that	everyone adores	the	uniqueness	of	their	children-we	love	that	each	one	is	as	different and	special	as	a	snowflake-and	yet,	many	parents	want	a	cookie-cutter	version of	potty	training.	There's	no	such	thing.	It	doesn't	exist.	Also,	it	infuriates	me that	 your	 neighbor	 with	 two	 children	 thinks	 she	 knows	 everything	 about	 this potty	training	gig.

While	 there	 are	 many	 potty	 training	 'methods,'	 there	 are	 really	 only	 two general	systems	floating	around	out	there:

- 1.	Rewards
- 2.	Consistency	and	commitment

## That's	it.

We	are	going	to	work	within	the	second	system.	Your	child	is	special;	she	has her	very	own	genetic	makeup.	She	has	her	very	own	learning	method	and	speed. We	have	to	honor	that,	okay?	If	there	were just	one	way to	potty	train	your	child -absolutely	guaranteed,	no	hassles,	in	three	days	flat-that	crap	would	be	on Oprah (or	would've	been,	anyway).	It'd	be	viral	in	seconds.	We'd	all	know	about it.	But	we	are	dealing	with humans ,	who	react	as	individuals	and	have	their	own

-albeit,	not	exactly	logical-thought	processes,	and	who	not	only	know	how	to push	your	buttons,	they	actually	installed	your	buttons.

Using	the	potty	is	both	one	of	the	first	things	you	actively	teach	your	child, and	one	of	the	first	 things	 he	 actively	 learns.	 What	 we	 are	 going	 to	 discover through	this	process	is	how	your	child	thinks. Having	a	preconceived	notion	of	how long	this	will	take	is	REALLY,	HONESTLY	going	to	muck	things	up	for	you. You will	unwittingly	put	too	much	pressure	on	your	child,	and	you	will	drive	yourself insane.	Trust	me.	I	know	this.

I	see	people	getting	tripped	up	on	this	all	the	time.	You	want	to	potty	train with	consistency,	and	you	don't	want	it	to	take	a	year.	Realistically,	I	can	tell you	 it	 takes	 most	 people	 around	 seven	 to	 ten	 days.	 Through	 all	 my	 years	 of doing	this,	I've	come	to	believe	that	there's	a	truly	magical	window	of	about	two weeks'	 duration	 in	 each	 child's	 life	 during	 which	 he	 will	 potty	 train	 so effortlessly	 it's	 amazing.	 However,	 when	those	two	weeks	are	going	to	happen for	any	one	kid	is	anyone's	guess,	and	there's	no	outward	signal	as	to	when	they are	 occurring.	 So	 when	 you	 hear	 one	 of	 those	 miraculous	 stories	 from	 your friend/neighbor/sister,	they	got	lucky	is	all.

Before	you	actually	begin	any	potty	training,	you	will	need	to	do	a	few	things in	preparation	for	getting	started.

## Set	a	date.

You	 need	 to	 pick	 a	 date	 to	 start	 the	 process.	 You	 can	 pick	 any	 start	 date.	 I usually	recommend	starting	about	two	weeks	after	reading	this	book,	but	really, tomorrow	is	fine,	too.	The	two-week	waiting	period	is	to	prepare	you	and	to	give your	 mind	 a	 break.	 Chances	 are,	 you've	 been	 spending	 a	 lot	 of	 time	 lately reading	up	on	potty	training,	thinking	about	it,	asking	around	the	playground, fending	off	the	know-it-alls,	and	feeling	a	little	guilty	every	time	you	change	a diaper.	 Give	 yourself	 two	 weeks	 NOT	 to	 think	 about	 it.	 Set	 a	 date	 that	 will allow	you,	and	hopefully	your	partner,	to	focus	fully	on	potty	training	for	three or	four	days.	Holiday	weekends	are	perfect.	This	is	the	same	sort	of	preparation period	people	go	through	when	they	pick	a	date	to	start	a	workout	routine,	a diet,	 or	 to	 quit	 smoking.	 It	 gives	 you	 that	 last	 hoorah.	 Set	 your	 date	 and luxuriate	in	diapers	for	those	two	weeks.	The	waiting	period	also	preps	you	for	a major	transition	in	your	child's	life-from	baby	to	little	kid.	I	find	some	parents have	a	fear	about	giving	up	their	baby.	It's	a	bittersweet	time	and	worth	selfexamination.	 It's	 my	 personal	 philosophy	 that	 we	 shouldn't	 try	 to	 hold	 our children	back	to	fill	our	own	emotional	needs.	In	a	bit,	I'll	offer	some	advice	to help	both	you	and	your	child	cope	with	the	emotions	of	the	transition.

## Get	a	potty	chair,	or	if	you	already	have	one	out,	put	it	in	hiding.

Every	single	parent	who	has	attended	my	class	has	made	the	'put	the	pot	out	so they	can	get	used	to	it'	mistake.	If	you	haven't	put	it	out,	don't.	If	you	have	and your	child	has only ever	used	it	to	pee	and	poop	in,	you	may	leave	it	out.	If	the potty	chair	has	been	used	for	anything	else	besides	peeing	and	pooping,	put	it away.

I	 also	 don't	 suggest	 letting	 your	 child	 pick	 her	 own	 potty	 chair.	 They'll inevitably	pick	one	with	bells	and	whistles,	and	you	don't	need	that.	This	isn't	a toy.	Personally,	I'm	a	huge	fan	of	the	BabyBjörn	potty	chairs.	If	your	child	asks to	use	the	potty	chair	between	now	and	your	selected	start	date,	go	ahead	and let	him.	So,	say	you've	set	a	start	date	for	two	weeks	from	now.	He's	been	using the	potty,	but	inconsistently.	Still,	it's	in	the	bathroom	and	has	not	become	any sort	of	toy.	You	can	leave	it	out.	During	the	two	weeks	between	now	and	your start	date,	if	he	asks	to	use	it,	let	him.	But	don't	make	a	big	deal	about	it.	Just say,	 'Thank	 you	 for	 using	 the	 potty.'	 You	 are	 not	 going	 to	 mention	 potty training.	You	are	not	going	to	give	accolades.	Just	go	with	a	simple	thank	you	or a	reflection	back	to	him:	'You	used	the	potty	chair	to	pee	in.	Thank	you.'

## Clear	your	social	calendar	for	a	week,	starting	with	your	start	date.

Just	to	clarify,	let's	say	you've	decided	to	start	potty	training	in	two	weeks	on	a Sunday.	You	will	clear	your	calendar	for	a	week,	starting	with	that	Sunday.

I	usually	crack	up	at	the	look	on	moms'	faces	when	I	say	this.	Jaws	drop,	faces go	 white.	 What?!	 Yes,	 clear	 your	 calendar	 for	 a	 week.	 (Don't	 worry,	 working moms:	we'll	hit	day	care	situations	in	a	bit.)

You	will	 be	 home	 for	 the	 first	 few	 days,	 with	 small	 outings	 planned.	 After that,	you	want	to	be	at	your	child's	bathroom	beck	and	call	for	at	least	a	week. The	 reason	 for	 this	 calendar	 clearing	 is	 simple:	 if	 you	 have	 things	 planned, you're	more	likely	to	get	stressed	out.	What	if	your	child	had	a	lot	to	drink	in the	morning	and	doesn't	pee	and	it's	time	for	Music	Together,	story	time	at	the library,	 a	 play	 date,	 or	 whatever?	 You	 are	 more	 likely	 to	 pressure	 him	 or	 get aggravated.	You're	tempting	fate	with	an	accident	in	the	car.	What	if	your	child has	to	poop,	and	you're	in	the	one	place	that	has	an	out-of-order	toilet?	At	this point,	you	will	be	only	three	days	into	potty	training;	you	will	still	have	a	way	to go	 before	 you	 and	 your	 child	 absolutely	 know	 his	 signals.	 Set	 up	 yourself	 and your	child	for	success!

I'm	asking	you	to	clear	a	small	amount	of	time.	I've	had	parents	practically flip	 out	 and	 tell	 me	 they	 can't	 possibly	 stay	 home	 for	 a	 few	 days,	 to	 which	 I respond	that	if	you	can't	stay	home	with	your	child	for	a	few	days,	you	might want	 to	 change	 your	 priorities.	 At	 this	 age,	 your	 child	 should	 be	 neither overscheduled	nor	overstimulated	with	entertainment.	If	you	and	your	partner are	 both	 full-time	 workers	 out	 of	 the	 home,	 I've	 got	 a	 whole	 chapter	 on	 day cares;	 that	 is	 its	 own	 ball	 of	 wax.	 In	 a	 full-time	 day	 care	 situation,	 it's	 usually best	to	pick	a	three-day	holiday	weekend,	and	maybe	even	take	an	extra	day	off to	make	it	a	four-day	weekend.	The	more	time	your	child	has	to	learn	this	with you ,	in	the	familiar	setting	of home ,	the	better	it	sticks.

An	interesting	side	note	to	clearing	your	calendar:	just	one	generation	ago, kids	were	potty	trained	at	seventeen	to	twenty-two	months.	I	truly	believe	it's because	our	moms,	for	the	most	part,	were	stay-at-home	moms.	I	mean	stay	at home.	 They	 didn't	 work	 at	 home,	 they	 had	 no	 computer	 for	 email	 and Facebook,	 no	 cell	 phones,	 no	 identities	 to	 preserve,	 no	 mommy	 groups,	 no playdates,	no	baby	gymnastics,	no	music	classes,	and	no	swimming	lessons.	Now, I'm	 forty-three,	 so	 maybe	 I'm	 talking	 to	 a	 younger	 audience	 here,	 and	 I'm certainly	not	saying	our	moms	exhibited	the	best	parenting.	But	I	do	believe	it was	that	stay-at-home	factor	that	made	potty	training	so	easy.	Between	my	mom and	her	three	best	friends,	they	literally	had	twenty	kids	in	a	ten-year	span.	All four	moms	used	cloth	diapers,	and	none	had	a	dryer.	And	each	of	those	kids	was fully	potty	trained	by	twenty-two	months.

If	 there's	 any	 pressure	for	your	child	to	perform,	it'll	backfire	and	have	you unnecessarily	pulling	your	hair	out.	Do	yourself	a	favor	and	listen	to	me.	Clear your	calendar.	Please	don't	make	the	mistake	of	assuming	your	child	is	going	to be	 the	 potty	 training	 all-star.	 They	 exist,	 but	 usually	 where	 we	 don't	 expect them.	Do	not	think	I'm	making	this	up.	Many	parents	have	fallen	prey	to	the fantasy	'My	kid	is	smart,	he'll	pick	this	up.	I'm	clearing	my	calendar	for	three days	and	then	that's	it!	Back	to	business	as	usual.	I	don't	have	time	for	this	to take	longer	than	that.'

Again,	trust	me.	That	very	thinking	will	lead	to	tears-yours.

## One	Week	Before	the	Big	Day

Start	talking	about	throwing	away	diapers.	Don't	mention	potty	training.	Don't mention	 anything	 about	 the	 toilet	 or	 pee	 or	 poop.	 Just	 mention	 as	 you're changing	diapers,	'On	Sunday,	we're	going	to	throw	your	diapers	away.'	This should	 be	 level	 and	 calm	 and	 very	 loving.	 Don't	 show	 your	 nerves	 and	 don't make	it	a	big	deal.	The	logic	behind	this	is	it's	not	wrought	with	anxiety.	Who can't	throw	away	a	few	diapers?	Jeez,	Mom	.	.	.	that's	easy.

This	is	also	a	great	time	to	start	with	big	boy/girl	talk.	Start	going	through	the list	 of	 big	 kid	 stuff	 your	 child	 does.	 Kids	 love	 hearing	about	what	they	can	do now	that	they	couldn't	do	as	a	baby.	This	is	preparing	both	you	and	your	child for	the	end	of	this	baby	portion	of	her	life.

This	 particular	 phase	 in	 your	 child's	 life	 is	 also	 a	 place	 in	 which	 your language	can	generate	a	mixed	message.	See	if	these	sounds	familiar:

'Who's	my	baby?'

- 'No,	honey,	that's	not	for	little	kids.'
- 'Stop	that	now,	you're	a	big	girl.'
- So,	what	is	your	child?	A	big	kid,	a	little	kid,	or	a	baby?

It	may	not	seem	like	that	big	a	deal,	but	being	able	to	recognize	and	address this	 will	 come	 in	 handy.	 Sometimes	 our	 big	 kids	 need	 babying,	 and	 it's	 good when	they	can	separate	and	articulate	that.	One	child	I	worked	with	years	ago came	up	with	the	phrase	'I	need	some	baby	love.'	I	thought	this	was	brilliant and	adopted	it	when	training	my	own	son.	It	worked	like	magic.	Kids	aren't	so afraid	 of	 becoming	 a	 'big	 kid'	 if	 they	 know	 they	 can	 have	 some	 'baby	 love' when	they	need	it.	Right	now,	they're	in	limbo;	we	know	they	aren't	really	big kids,	 but	 they	 aren't	 babies	 either.	 To	 this	 day,	 Pascal	 asks	 for	 'baby	 love' (actually,	he	calls	it	Mama	Love,	but	it	means	the	same).	It	lasts	about	thirty seconds,	and	then	he's	on	to	bigger	and	better	'big	boy'	things.	Still,	it	gives	us that	infusion	of	love	and	snuggles	we	both	crave.

So	you've	set	a	date,	ideally	giving	yourself	a	two-week	head	start.	You've	put the	potty	chair	away	for	now.	You've	cleared	your	social	calendar	for	a	week. And	you've	planted	the	idea,	super	casual-like,	that	you	are	tossing	diapers	out.

## Now	.	.	.	are	you	done,	done?	With	diapers,	I	mean?

This	is	an	added	section	of	the	book	since	the	first	edition	because	it	didn't	used to	 be	 such	 a	 huge	 problem,	 largely	 because	 we	 didn't	 used	 to	 have	 such	 huge online	communities.	What's	the	problem?	Self-doubt.	On	the	surface,	it	doesn't appear	to	be	a	problem,	but	in	reality,	it's	the	worst	kind.	It	chips	away	at	this process	 and	 makes	 it	 nearly	 impossible	 to	 potty	 train.	 I	 can	 always	 tell	 when parental	 self-doubt	 is	 the	 niggling	 issue	 underneath	 a	 child	 who	 'just	 doesn't seem	to	be	getting	it.'	There	are	all	manner	of	problems	that	can	arise	when	you are	teaching	your	child	this	new	skill,	but	'just	not	getting	it'	shouldn't	be	one of	them.	If	dogs	have	the	capacity	to	house	train	in	under	a	week,	surely	human children	can	do	this	as	well.	If	you	find	yourself	saying-or	maybe	you've	already attempted	potty	training	and	have	said-'He's	just	not	getting	it,'	chances	are self-doubt	is	your	problem.

I	call	it	' done ,	done.'

Are	you	really	ready	to	potty	train	your	child?	Are	you	done	with	diapers	or are	you done ,	done	with	diapers?	I	know	you	are	going	to	say	you	are	done	with diapers.	But	are	you really ?

I	find	that	most	parents	really	can't	wait	to	be	done	with	diapers,	but	I	also find	those	same	parents	are	in	two	camps	regarding	the	process	of	potty	training their	child:	sure	and	unsure.	Where	are	you?	Think	about	this	carefully.	It's	the best	indicator	of	how	the	process	will	go	for	you.	Ask	yourself	a	few	questions	to help	determine	where	you	are:

- 1.	Are	you	going	into	potty	training	thinking	you'll	give	it	a	try	and	see	what	happens?	We've	talked a	little	about	the	word try ,	but	I	mean	it for	real :	your	head	can't	be	in	this	place.	'Trying'	to	potty train	sets	a	clear	expectation	that	you	don't	expect	it	to	work.	Why	try?	Instead,	why	not	pretend that	I	single-handedly	managed	to	blow	up	every	disposable	diaper	factory.	(I	dream	big.	Naturally this	takes	place	while	I'm	clad	in	a	black	Latex	cat	suit.)	There	are	no	more	diapers.	Of	course,	I'm joking	.	.	.	kind	of.	Don't	give	yourself	a	wimpy	start	with	'We're	going	to	try.'	In	fact,	if	you	plan to	 'try,'	 don't	 bother	 starting.	 It's	 not	 going	 to	 happen	 if	 you	 try.	 It	 will	 happen	 when	 you do . Remember	Yoda.	Do	or	do	not.	There	is	no	try.
- 2.	Are	you	unsure	that	your	child	is	ready?	Are	you	worried	that	she's	too	young?	Most	of	the	first chapters	in	this	book	are	to	reassure	you	that	it	is	not	only	possible	but preferable to	 potty	train when	your	child	is	younger.	But	if	you	still	think	your	child	is	too	young	or	somehow	not	capable, the	process	will	be	an	epic	failure	for	you.	'Ready'	is	a	nebulous	concept.	It's	better	to	ask	yourself, 'Is	 my	 child	 CAPABLE	 of	 doing	 this?'	 Answer	 this	 question	 deep	 in	 your	 own	 gut.	 Everyone around	you	is	going	to	have	an	opinion,	I	assure	you. Don't	listen	to	everyone	else .	Listen	to	what your	heart	says	about	your	child.
- 3.	 Why	do	you	want	your	child	to	potty	train?	This	is	a	tricky	one.	Be	honest	with	yourself.	Yes, pretty	much	every	parent	wants	to	be	done	with	diapers.	That's	an	okay	motivator,	but	not	a	great one.	It's	like	eating	healthy	to	lose	weight.	You	have	to	have	a	stronger	motivator	than	that	or	it crumbles	under	pressure.	Also,	look	really	deep	inside.	When	I	first	met	former	client	'Elizabeth,' it	was	because	this	whole	process	had	fallen	apart	for	her.	She	did	everything	by	the	book.	Also, her	child's	learning	curve	was	slow.	She	admitted-in	a	very	vulnerable	way,	which	I	truly	admire -that	she	was	embarrassed.	She	wanted	to	be	the	first	of	her	friends	to	potty	train,	and	it	wasn't going	well	for	her.	That	wasn't	the	only	reason	the	process	fell	apart,	but	it	put	a	pretty	powerful crack	in	it.	Don't	potty	train	right	now	because	you	want	an	all-star.	Without	fail,	you	won't	have one.	Don't	do	this	to	prove	anyone	wrong.

What is a	good	reason	to	potty	train	your	child?	Well,	to	give	him	self-esteem	and	self-pride	in mastering	of	a	skill.	My favorite kind	of	thank	you-and	I	hear	it	often-goes	something	like	this: 'I	just	LOVE	the	look	on	my	daughter's	face.	She	is	SO	proud	of	herself.'	I	say	it	over	and	over: you	 don't	 hand	 your	 child	 self-esteem.	 She	 develops	 it	 by	 mastering	 tasks. That is a	 great motivator!

- 4.	What	do	all	your	friends	and	immediate	family	think	of	you	potty	training?	This	is huge .	If	every day	is	a	battle	for	you-all	the	people	in	your	close	circle	are	jamming	down	your	throat	that	your kid	is	too	young-you	are	going	to	have	massive	doubts.	Potty	train	anyway,	but	be	sure	you	get your	head	on	tight	beforehand	and	keep	it	there	during	the	process.	Perhaps	don't	hang	out	with any	friends	for	a	week.

I	 cannot	 tell	 you	 how	 much	 a	 doubting	 circle	 of	 friends	 and	 family	 damages	 your	 resolve.	 I originally	tried	to	potty	train	Pascal	at	eighteen	months,	because	I	know	it's	absolutely	possible	to do	at	that	age.	I'm	a	single	mom,	and	at	that	time,	I	owned	a	store,	and	knew	his	day	care	wasn't on	board	with	my	plans.	I	knew	within	the	first	four	hours	of	our	first	day	of	potty	training	that	it wasn't	'clicking'	easily	for	him.	I	realized	potty	training	him	at	that	time	was	still	possible,	but	that it	 would	take	longer	than	a	couple	of	days.	I	abandoned	ship	and	he	did	just	fine	at	twenty-two months.	The only reason	 I'm	 telling	 you	 this	 story	 is	 because	 my	 circle	 of	 'friends'	 at	 this	 time couldn't	wait	to	gloat.	I'm	serious!	'See,	told	you	so.'	I	phased	them	out	of	my	life	in	short	order. Screw	that.	For	real.	You	should	be	able	to	potty	train	your	child	without	everyone	coming	down on	you.	'If	only	I	could	potty	train	on	a	deserted	island	for	two	weeks,	I'd	be	fine'	is	a	sentiment	I hear	often	from	clients.	Don't	let	the	naysayers	get	you	down.	I	don't	know	why,	but	this	is	an	area where	people	feel	very	free	to	tell	you	exactly	what	you're	doing	wrong.	It's	bizarre	to	me.	Nobody would	dream	of	telling	you	how	to	discipline	your	children,	right?

I	 think	 the	 problem	 of	 the	 naysayers	 has	 a	 deeper	 level,	 too.	 If	 you	 potty	 train	 your	 kid successfully,	then	the	people	who	said	you	couldn't	do	it	look	like	lame-os.	And	you've	just	kicked their	 parenting	 advice	 to	 the	 mat.	 In	 other	 words,	 they	 have	 an	 emotional	 investment	 in	 your failure.	So	be	wary	of	well-meaning	friends	who	tell	you	that	your	child	is	too	young.	Or	that	you are	doing	it	wrong.	Or	that	you	should	just	give	your	kid	a	freaking	piece	of	candy	every	time	she poops.	Question	these	folks	outright	if	you're	feeling	brave.	'Why	are	you	so	invested	in	when	I potty	train	my	child?'

Plus-I	 know	 this	 from	 Facebook-in	 short	 order,	 you	 are	 going	 to	 have	 awesome	 bragging rights.	But	just	don't	go	into	potty	training	with	that	as	the	sole	purpose,	okay?

If	 you	 breezed	 through	 those	 last	 four	 questions,	 go	 back	 and	 ask	 yourself again.	Be	sure	you	are	ready	to do this.	Be	confident	that	your	child	not	only	has the	 capability	 to	 do	 it,	 but	 that	 he	 will	 blossom	 in	 this	 newfound	 skill.	 Potty train for the right reasons-because it's time, because it's the next developmental	milestone,	and,	yeah,	maybe	to	stick	it	to	Big	Diaper.	Be	sure	you have	support	around	you	or	that	you	avoid	the	people	who	don't	support	you.

I	 really	 can't	express	how	important	those	points	are!	Yes,	it's	okay	to	be	a little	nervous.	Some	people	have	made	potty	training	into	a	huge	ordeal,	largely because	they	waited	too	long	and	now	do	have	real	disasters	on	their	hands.	In the	majority	of	cases,	though,	it's	just	not	that	big	a	deal.	Sure,	it's	okay	to	have a	 tiny	 pocket	 of	 concern	 or	 doubt.	 Just	 don't	 go	 in	 with	 the	 pocket	 of	 doubt leading	 the	 show.	 I	 see	 this	 time	 and	 time	 and	 time	 again,	 and	 your	 child absorbs	his	attitude	toward	potty	training	from	you.	Whether	you	call	it	'vibe' or	'energy'	or	'nonverbal	cues,'	the	fact	of	the	matter	is	that	children	absorb our	energy.	They	feel	the	emotional	undercurrent	of	any	given	situation.	Your child	can	tell	if	you	are	sad	even	when	you're	putting	on	your	happy	face.	Your child	is	extremely	sensitive;	all	kids	are.	They	don't	have	the	layers	of	emotional armor	we've	piled	on	ourselves	so	as	not	to	be	so	vulnerable. They	will	feel	your vibe.

If	you	are	doubting,	they	will	be	doubting,	and	the	result	will	look	like	they're 'not	getting	it.'	 If	 your	 prevailing	 thoughts	 are, I'm	not	sure	 she's	 ready ,	 guess what?	It's	going	to	look	like	she's	not	ready	or	'not	getting	it.'	Expectations	and, therefore,	outcomes	will	be	very	unclear.	She'll	be	getting	mixed	messages	from you,	and	they	will	confuse	her.	She	won't	have	the	words	to	say,	'Hey,	Mom, I'm	getting	two	different	things	from	you	right	now.	I'm	not	sure	what	I'm	doing here.'	Instead,	she	just	'won't	get	it'	as	far	as	the	potty	training	goes.	If	your mouth	is	saying	one	thing	and	your	heart	is	saying	another,	she	will	be	confused. Make	sense?

Now	for	 a	 few	 major	 modern-day	 issues	 that	 need	 to	 be	 addressed.	 These aren't	questions	and	answers,	per	se,	but	addressing	these	issues	is	definitely	in the	'get	your	head	screwed	on	tight'	category.

## Nix	the	Facebook	status.	For	now.

For	 the	 love	 of	 all	 that	 is	 holy,	 please	 do	 not	 post	 on	 Facebook	 that	 you	 are starting	potty	training.	When	you	are	done,	post	away.	Make	it	your	status	every day	for	a	freaking	year,	if	you	want!	But	if	you	post	about starting potty	training, you	 will	 immediately	 get	 at	 least	 thirty-four	 comments	 from	 all	 kinds	 of 'experts.'	I'm	really	glad	your	best	friend	used	candy	to	potty	train	her	kid,	but you know	better.	Well-meaning	friends	are	going	fill	you	with	doubt.	If	you	are experiencing	troubles	or	doubts	or	just	want	to	bitch,	join	us	on	the	Oh	Crap! Potty	Training	Facebook	page,	where	you'll	find	like-minded	mamas	and	lots	of good	support.	Don't	expect	that	on	your	personal	Facebook	page.

## Sleep

Yes,	we	are	moms.	We	are	the	legions	of	the	underrested.	I'm	talking	about	you, but	more	important,	I'm	talking	about	your	child.	Our	children	as	a	whole	are grossly	sleep	deprived.	A	two-year-old	needs	around	twelve	hours	of	sleep	a	day, and	most	don't	get	anywhere	near	that	much.	The	craziest	thing	about	sleep	is that	a	tired	kid	acts	like	a	wired	kid.	So	when	it's	around	seven	in	the	evening, and	you	think	your	kid	isn't	tired	because	he's	chasing	the	dog	around	in	circles, you're	likely	wrong.	That	kid	is	probably	overtired.	Another	important	sign	of an	overtired	kid	is	if	bedtime	is	a	fiasco.	Bedtime	shouldn't	be	a	hassle.	If	it	is, chances	 are	 your	 child	 is	 overtired.	 Overtired	 kids	 are	 clumsier,	 have	 more freak-outs	 and	 tantrums,	 'poke'	 at	 others,	 and	 are	 generally	 fussier.	 'No	 I waaaant	the	pink	cup.	No.	The	blue	cup.	No.	The	pink	cup.'	You	know	the drill.	Of	course,	toddlers	are	known	for	their	fickleness,	but	tired	kids	tend	to	go above	 and	 beyond	 with	 regard	 to	 the	 crazy. Fix	 sleep	 before	 beginning	 potty training. Always,	 always	 go	 for more sleep.	 If	 you	 and	 your	 child	 have	 been struggling	with	sleep,	please	get	help before potty	training.	My	go-to	sleep	expert is	 Alanna	 McGinn	 of	 The	 Good	 Night	 Sleep	 Site.	 She's	 amazing	 at	 getting parents	 and	 children	 back	 on	 track	 with	 good,	 healthy	 sleep	 habits.	 I'm	 not going	to	spend	a	whole	lot	of	time	talking	about	sleep,	but	you	really	want	this duck	in	the	row	before	you	begin.

## Potty	train	the	kid	you	have.

This	is	a	good	one.	You	have	the	kid	you	have,	not	necessarily	the	kid	you	want. You	cannot	change	your	zebra's	stripes.	This	is	hard	for	us	to	admit	and	hard	to remember.	We	all	want	the	well-behaved,	loving,	courteous	child.	But	we	got what	 we	 got.	 And	 no	 matter	 what,	 our	 love	 is	 fierce.	 While	 you	 are	 potty training,	be	careful	not	to	linger	in	the	'I	wish	he	.	.	.'	fantasy	world.	Deal	with the	kid	and	the	problems	you	have.	Your	fantasies	are	irrelevant.	Wishing	your child	would	be	different	doesn't	serve	anyone.	There's	a	lot	of	'nature'	in	this here	 'nurture.'	 The	 goal	 is	 always	 to	 work	 with	 your	 child's	 strengths.	 While working	with	a	client,	I	never	try	to	'fix'	a	perceived	weakness.	We	build	on what	your	kid	inherently	has.

There's	 another	 aspect	 to	 making	 sure	 you're	 potty	 training	 'the	 kid	 you have.'	If	your	child	has	a	particular	'problem'	before	you	start	potty	trainingsay	he's	whiny,	or	she's	resistant,	or	he's	prone	to	histrionics	and	tantrums-you are	 going	 to	 have	 that	 same	 kid	 and	 the	 same	 problem	 while	 you	 are	 potty training.	That's	not	a	judgment.	All	these	behaviors	are	normal,	and	there's	not a	single	one	I	have	not	seen.	The	behavior	isn't	the	real	issue,	in	fact.	The	real problem	is	when	parents	somehow	convince	themselves	that	potty	training	is going	 to	 happen	 in	 a	 bubble,	 that all the	 other	 behavior	 your	 child	 typically exhibits	is	somehow	going	to	disappear	while	you	are	potty	training.	Not	only will	it	still	be	there-it	may	even	get	magnified	for	a	short	time.	Again,	it's	all good.	Just	keep	your	expectations	level.

## Pants,	Clothing,	and	Independence

Does	your	child	dress	herself?	You	might	want	to	get	started	teaching	this	skill	if your	child	doesn't	already	possess	it.	I	find	it's	something	we	don't	even	really think	about	until	we	start	potty	training,	and	then	it's	like	AHHHH!

It's important	 to	 remember	 that	 a	 lot	 of	 kids	 don't	 yet	 know	 how	 to manipulate	their	clothing.	Nothing	is	more	frustrating	to	you or to	 your	 child than	knowing	he	has	to	pee	and	making	the	move	to	the	pot,	only	to	get	tied	up in	mangled	attempts	to	get	his	pants	down.	Ahhhhh!

A	few	things	can	help.	First	off,	who	the	heck	started	saying	' Pull your	pants down?'	Toddlers	are	very	literal.	While	teaching	them	how	to	use	their	pants, use	the	words	' Push your	pants	down.'	That's	really	what	they're	doing,	right?

Definitely	start	having	your	child	dress	themselves.	This,	in	and	of	itself,	is huge.	 It	 gives	 them	 such	 empowerment!	 It	 also	 makes	 for	 some	 massive	 skill building.	When	you	are	teaching	your	child	to	dress	herself,	it	can	sometimes require	a	few	more	words	than	'I'm	putting	your	pants	on.'	Remember,	this	is	a brand-new	skill	to	her!	So	really	break	down	what	you	are	doing:	'I'm	hooking my	 thumb	 into	 the	 elastic,	 see?	 And	 then	 I	 can	 grab	 them	 and	 push	 them down.'

Some	parents	have	found	a	'dressing	party'	has	helped.	Much	like	playing dress	up	clothes,	spend	an	hour	trying	on	outfits.	Make	it	seem	fun!	Practice	is the	key	here,	and	most	kids	at	this	age	don't	get	a	whole	lot	of	practice.	And	the pressure	of	a	looming	need	to	pee	doesn't	make	for	the	best	learning,	either.	So set	 up	 some	 teaching	 time	 to	 get	 the	 pants	 down,	 literally	 and	 figuratively.	 I can't	tell	you	how	frustrating	it	is	to	be this close	to	consistent	pee	in	the	potty and	have	the	dang	pants	mess	your	child	up!

This	 is	 also	 a	 good	 time	 to	 start	 really	 fostering	 some	 independence	 and setting	some	expectations.	Have	a	set	chore	for	your	child,	like	putting	his	dish in	 the	 sink	 after	 dinner.	 This	 makes	 your	 child	 feel	 big	 and	 independent,	 but also	envelops	him	in	a	feeling	of	being	part	of	the	whole.	They love having	and knowing	their	place	in	your	home.

## Dads/Partners

This	is	a	doozy!

Please	be	sure	your	partner	is	on	board	with	this	whole	process.	This	is	easier if	 you	 get	 them	on	board before you	 begin.	At	the	end	of	the	book,	there	is	a 'Dad's	Cheat	Sheet.'	I'm	saying	'dads'	for	majority,	but	other	moms,	partners, or	anyone	else	who	shares	caregiving	fit	in	this	category.	This	can	include	moms if	Dad	is	the	primary	caregiver.

Now,	I	want	to	be	super	clear	here.	I	am	making	some	huge	generalizations based	on	my	work	in	the	real	world.	This	entire	section	is	not	meant	to	alienate any partners	who	are	reading	this.	If	you are reading	this,	you	are	awesome.	I've been	 told	 some	 dads	 feel	 left	 out	 and	 pandered	 to	 in	 this	 chapter,	 and	 I apologize.	 Please	 realize	 there	 are	 masses	 of	 dads	 who	 aren't	 fully	 engaged	 in parenting.	 It's	 been	 such	 a	 problem	 in	 the	 past	 that	 I	 simply	 can't	 leave	 it without	addressing	it.	Thank	you	for	your	understanding.

Some	partners	really	love	reading	the	book	and	getting	involved,	and	some don't.	A	really	good	sign	your	partner	isn't	on	board	is	if	they	won't	read	this book	(or	at	least,	parts	of	it).	I'm	telling	you	straight	up,	this	is	going	to	be	a problem.

I	think	there	are	a	couple	of	reasons	some	dads	don't	jump	at	the	opportunity to	potty	train.	I	think	one	of	the	major	ones	is	that	they	aren't	used	to	doing	the bulk	 of	 the	 potty-related	 work.	 Often,	 they	 didn't	 change	 the	 majority	 of	 the diapers,	and	they	don't	expect	to	be	the	major	potty	trainer.	It's	a	common	joke that	men	won't	stop	for	directions.	Well,	consider	this	book	'directions.'	And for	a	guy	who	doesn't	want	to	ask	for	help,	advice	might	be	unwelcome.	Period.

Also,	the	majority	of	dads	are	working,	and	I	suspect	that	many	come	home and	want	to	be	the	'good	guy.'	Further,	they	are	tired	and	cranky	themselves,	so containing	crap	is	not	their	idea	of	fun.	I	get	it.	But	remind	them	that	this	is temporary .

Some	men	are	superlinear	thinkers	and	don't	really	connect	with	the	chaos of	the	toddler	mind.	I	can't	tell	you	how	many	times	I've	seen	a	situation	like this:	Mom's	been	working	her	butt	off	to	potty	train	the	kid	during	the	day.	She leaves	 the	 child	 in	 her	 husband's	 care	 for	 twenty	 minutes.	 The	 child	 has	 an accident.	Mom	asks	Dad	what	happened,	and	he	says,	'I	told	him	to	go	and	he said	no.'	I	think	dads	really	expect	that	you	only	have	to	tell	your	child	that	he needs	to	pee	in	the	potty	one	time	and	the	child	should	fully	comprehend	and comply.

If	you	sense	resistance	from	your	mate,	try	to	get	to	the	bottom	of	it	before you	begin.	If	you	begin	with	a	recalcitrant	mate,	potty	training	becomes	straight up	crazy.	You'll	spend	your	time	battling	and	trying	to	prove	yourself	rather	than teaching	your	child	to	use	the	toilet.	 This	 process	 of	 proving	 yourself	 to	 your mate	will	undermine	your	success	by	putting	you	on	edge.	It	will	also	put	a ton of pressure	on	your	child,	which	will	backfire	on	you.

Particular	 areas	 of	 resistance	 include	 that	 some	 dads	 honestly	 and	 truly believe	 the	 child	 is	 too	 young.	 After	 all,	 the	 (weird)	 norm	 right	 now	 in	 our country	is	protracted	diaper	wearing	and	delayed	potty	training,	so	you	might	be battling	 against	 your	 partner's	 perception	 of	 what's	 'normal'	 or	 'right'	 if	 you want	 to	 potty	 train	 right	 now.	 Add	 to	 this	 that	 some	 dads	 think	 rewards	 are good,	 and	 as	 we've	 already	 discussed,	 this	 is	 reward-free	 potty	 training.	 Then there	are	the	people	who	just	can't	commit	to	a	process	and	be	consistent.	They tend	to	be	wary	of	any	one	process	or	book	and	think	there's	something	better out	there.	I've	had	many	a	dad	question	my	process.	One	went	out	and	bought two	more	books.	Only	after	reading	them	did	he	come	to	realize	I	kind	of	have	a good	thing	here.

So,	 say	 you	 have	 flat-out	 refusal	 to	 participate	 or	 you	 are	 sensing	 some resistance.	First	off,	don't	ignore	it!	Yes,	you	may	have	a	child	who's	an	all-star, and	you	can	laugh	in	your	mate's	face	in	a	couple	of	days	and	do	the	'nah,	nah, nah,	 nah'	 dance	 soon	 enough.	 But	 my	 experience	 is	 that	 when	 one	 of	 the parents	 isn't	 into	 this,	 the	 process	 goes	 awry	 with	 your	 child.	 She's	 got	 two different	 energetic	 forces	 coming	 at	 her,	 and	 she'll	 be	 confused.	 Also,	 don't expect	your	partner	to	just	'stay	out	of	your	way.'	The	problem	is,	unless	your partner	is	gone	for	significant	chunks	of	time,	he	will	get	in	your	way	at	some point.	Your	child	is	also	destined	to	be	in	his	care	at	some	point.

What	you	can	do	is	try	to	have	a	heart-to-heart	in	a	down	moment-after sex	 if	 you	 can	 arrange	 it.	 Kidding.	 Kind	 of.	 I	 mean	 don't	 try	 to	 talk	 about	 it when	there's	chaos,	like	at	dinner	or	bedtime.	Try	to	get	at	what's	really	under his	 resistance.	 Bring	 up	 the	 various	 points	 I've	 mentioned.	 Ask	 him	 outright. Don't	let	him	get	away	with	vague	answers.	If	he	has	a	real,	honest,	legitimate objection,	that's	something	you	two	need	to	discuss	further	and	work	out.

If	you	suspect	he's	just	not	interested	because	he's	probably	not	the	one	doing the	work	.	.	.	not	good	enough.	I	think	sometimes	we	moms	trample	on	dads because	we	are	the	primary	caregivers	(huge	generalization,	but	you	know	what	I mean).	I've	had	dads	that,	as	it	turns	out,	were	just	hurt	that	the	mom	went	and decided	 to	 tackle	 a	 huge	 milestone	 without	 their	 input.	 He's	 vital	 to	 this process,	just	as	you	are,	so	let's	involve	him	right	from	the	beginning.	And	let's understand	and	validate	how	he	truly	feels	about	this	process,	yeah?

Oh,	and	when	your	kid is potty	 trained,	 you	 can	 expect	 Dad	 to	 practically explode	with	pride	and	lap	up	the	congratulations.	Seriously.

## A	Word	About	Potty	Chairs

It's	 a	 pretty	 good	 idea	 to	 have	 a	 little	 potty	 chair,	 even	 if	 you	 are	 morally opposed	to	them.	We	really	want	to	foster	independence.	Your	child	most	likely is	a	long	way	away	from	being	able	to	manage	the	big	toilet	alone,	even	with	a step	 stool.	 The	 potty	 chair	 is	 temporary;	 soon,	 he	 will	 be	 big	 enough	 for	 the 'regular'	toilet.	I	am	a	fan	of	both	potty	chairs	and	inserts	for	the	big	toilet.	I have	no	opinion	whatsoever	about	where	you	keep	the	potty	chair	or	how	many you	have	around	the	house.	Buy	a	pot	for	every	room	if	you	want.	I	wouldn't worry	about	any	sort	of	bathroom	etiquette	at	this	point.	I	know	some	parents feel	 strongly	 about	 only	 doing	 poop	 or	 pee	 in	 the	 bathroom,	 but	 personally	 I don't	 think	 it	 matters.	 Children	 need	 the	 convenience	 of	 a	 close-by	 potty. Privacy	and	bathroom	etiquette	will	come	naturally	with	time.

I	 will,	 however,	 point	 you	 toward this :	 the	 Squatty	 Potty.	 It	 is	 the	 most amazing	product	ever.	You	may	want	to	look	into	buying	one	as	an	extra	step stool	for	the	bathroom.	I'll	talk	more	about	that	in	chapter	10,	'Poop.'

## Potty	Training	a	Nursing	Toddler

If	 you	 are	 still	 nursing,	 right	 on!	 That's	 awesome.	 The	 approach	 to	 potty training	won't	be	any	different,	but	there	is	one	little	twist:	because	you	don't know	exactly	 how	 much	 is	 going	 in,	 you	 have	 to	 be	 a	 little	 more	 alert	 as	 to when	it	comes	out.	I	have	to	be	honest,	though:	in	my	observations,	breast	milk doesn't	act	like	'just'	a	beverage	in	the	toddler	body.	It	seems	to	count	as	food, as	far	as	the	body	is	concerned.	Here's	what	this	means:	if	your	child	drinks	10 ounces	of	water	or	juice,	you	can	be	pretty	certain	you're	going	to	get	at	least	6 ounces	of	pee	out	at	some	point.	With	breast	milk,	the	math	is	not	the	same.	Do not	try	to	wean	your	child	right	before	or	during	potty	training!	Potty	training	is a	big	transition,	and	your	child	won't	be	able	emotionally	to	handle	both	at	the same	 time.	 Plus,	 she	 may	 need	 the	 stability	 and	 comfort	 of	 your	 breast	 while acclimating	to	this	other	big	new	thing.

## Precious	Rugs,	Floors,	or	Furniture

Most	people	I	know	with	toddlers	don't	have	much	that's	truly	precious.	If	you do	have	rooms	with	expensive	oriental	rugs	or	items	of	furniture	that	cost	more than	your	house,	don't	potty	train	in	these	rooms.	Or	make	them	off-limits	for	a while.	You	will	freak	out	when	your	child	pees	or	poops	on	these,	and	there's	no greater	stall	in	potty	training	than	a	parental	freak-out. Casual is	 the	key	word here.	 Many	 parents-mostly	 renters	 or	 wooden-floor	 people-confine	 their child	to	the	kitchen	for	a	day	or	just	until	the	child	gets	the	basics	down.

So	those	are	the	major	issues	you	have	to	tackle	to	get	and	keep	your	head screwed	on	tight.	Once	you	are	clear	on	those	points,	believe	me	.	.	.	this	process is	going	to	go	so	much	more	smoothly!	Go	back	and	read	the	chapter	again,	if you	 have	 to.	 It's	 worth	 getting	 the	 steps	 to	 mental	 preparation	 nailed	 down before	proceeding.	Once	you've	got	your	mind	prepared,	take	a	deep	breath,	and cue	up	the	music	from Jaws :	dundundundun	.	.	.

## CHAPTER	5

## Ditch	the	Diapers!	The	How-To

S o,	you've	done	your	mental	prep.	Your	head	is	screwed	on	tight.	You've	cleared your	calendars	and	you	are	ready	to	ditch	the	diapers.

Remember	the	timeline.	We	are	taking	your	child's	awareness	from	Clueless to	I	Peed	to	I'm	Peeing	to	I	Have	to	Go	Pee.

This	timeline	is	potty	training	in	a	nutshell.	That's	it!	(Hahahaha!)

I	want	you	to	think	of	potty	training	as	being	made	up	of	blocks	of	learning. I'm	 going	 to	 call	 them	 just	 that:	 blocks	 or	 phases.	 No	 matter	 where	 you	 are starting	 from,	 you	 need	 to	 think	 of	 the	 potty	 training	 process	 as	 a	 tower	 of blocks	that	you	are	building.	If	one	block	is	not	learned	properly,	the	tower	will be	unstable	and	will	tumble.	Thinking	in	this	way	makes	potty	training	so	much more	approachable.	Breaking	potty	training	down	into	blocks	like	this	will	also give	you	a	really	good	idea	of	where	and	when	things	went	wrong	if	there	are any	struggles	later	on.	Parents	who	don't	break	potty	training	into	blocks	and have	struggles	often	don't	know	where	it	went	wrong.	With	the	block	approach, you	can	say	something	like,	'Oh!	He	had	block	one	down	pat.	It	was	only	when we	moved	to	block	two	that	he	started	struggling.'	This	is	extremely	helpful	for troubleshooting.	Because	our	kids	aren't	robots,	there	are	all	kinds	of	emotions, behaviors,	and	actual	gaps	in	learning	that	can	really	muck	up	the	final	goal. The	block	method	allows	us	to	separate	these	things	out	from	one	another	so	we can	figure	 out	 what's	 causing	 the	 problem.	 As	 a	 bonus,	 potty	 training	 doesn't look	as	overwhelming	when	we	think	about	it	in	small	chunks.

Here	are	the	major	blocks	or	phases,	in	order:

- 1.	Peeing	and	pooping	while	naked,	either	with	prompting	or	without.
- 2.	Peeing	and	pooping	with	clothes	on,	commando,	with	prompting	or	without.
- 3.	Peeing	and	pooping	in	different	situations,	with	prompting	or	without.
- 4.	Peeing	and	pooping	with	underpants,	with	prompting	or	without.
- 5.	Consistent	self-initiation.
- 6.	Night	and	nap	(unless	you	are	choosing	to	do	it	all	together;	more	on	that	later).
- 7.	College.	Probably	still	needing	to	prompt	occasionally.

I	am	going	to	walk	you	through	each	block	and	tell	you how to	do	it	and what you	 should	 be	 looking	 for.	 I'll	 give	 you	 some	 suggestions	 and	 a	 few	 heads-up about	 specific	 potential	 problems.	 A	 more	 complete	 list	 of	 problems	 will	 be addressed	in	later	chapters.	I	don't	want	to	muck	up	the	how-to	by	discussing every	potential	problem	right	up	front	because	many,	many	parents	breeze	right through	this	without	a	hitch.	Okay,	ready?

## Your	Start	Date:	Block	One

I	used	to	recommend	that	you	make	this	day	a	really	big	deal.	I	used	to	suggest junky	food	and	lots	of	juice	and	a	really	fun	atmosphere.	But	over	the	last	few years,	 I've	 changed	 my	 mind.	 It	 used	 to	 seem	 that	 kids	 loved	 a	 day	 out	 of routine,	but	more	recently,	it	seems	that	such	a	deviation	from	the	norm	puts kids	 on	 high	 alert.	 I	 also	 have	 amended	 the	 junky	 food	 recommendation.	 I started	potty	training	before	I	was	a	mom,	and	I	thought	sugar	highs	were	kind of	 cute	 in	 other	 people's	 kids.	 Now	 that	 I'm	 a	 mom,	 though-and	 kind	 of	 a health	food	nut-I	no	longer	find	the	sugar	highs	cute,	nor	do	I	think	the	junk food	is	necessary.

We	want	potty	training	to	be	the	new	norm	for	your	child,	and	the	best	way to	do	that	is	to	normalize	the	process	as	much	as	possible	for	her.	That's	why	we don't	want	the	potty	training	start	day	to	be	so	crazy	and	out-of-routine	that	it fills	your	kid	with	unease.	I	also	have	a	theory	that	life	these	days	is	just	moving too	fast.	As	a	result,	I	think	all	of	our	kids	are	getting	anxious	in	general.	I	think the	economy	and	politics	and	all	these	grown-up	concerns	are	wiring	our	kids	in a	huge,	'collective	consciousness'	way.	I	think	there	are	many	issues	associated with	this	collective	vibe	even	if	we,	as	individuals,	do	our	best	to	combat	it.	But really,	that's	another	book	entirely.

For	now,	let's	just	say	that	it's	best	to	begin	the	potty	training	process	with both	 you	 and	 your	 child	 as	 even-keeled	 and	 level	 as	 possible.	 To	 that	 end,	 I suggest	 you	 start	 with	 as	 little	 fanfare	 as	 possible,	 so	 that	 you normalize this process	as	much	as	is	humanly	possible.	Using	the	toilet	is	just	something	we	all do	 as	 socialized	 beings.	 I	 want	 to	 remind	 you	 here,	 peeing	 and	 pooping	 are primal	 behaviors.	 You	 don't	 have	 to	 teach	 your	 child how to	 pee	 or	 poop. Through	 potty	 training,	 you	 are	 simply	 teaching	 your	 child where to	 put	 his waste.	 Putting	 his	 waste	 in	 an	 appropriate	 container	 is socialized . And	 our particular	society,	the	appropriate	container	is	a	toilet.

Here	 we	 go!	 To	 begin	 the	 first	 block	 of	 learning,	 take	 the	 diaper	 off	 your child.	 If	 you	 want,	 you	 can	 make	 a	 show	 of	 throwing	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 diapers away,	or	you	can	simply	say,	'Today,	you	are	going	to	be	a	big	girl	and	put	your pee	and	poop	in	the	potty.	I'm	going	to	teach	you	and	help	you	learn	this.	Yay! It's	 very	 fun.'	 You	don't	have	to	use	those	exact	words,	but	you	want	to	state what's	happening	very	clearly,	and	you	want	to	sound	like	it's	cool.	Think	of how	you	would	say,	'Today,	we're	going	to	the	dentist,'	and	try	to	hit	the	same tone.	You	want	to	sound	cool	and	casual,	and	avoid	any	hint	that	you	anticipate drama.	 Clear.	 Succinct.	 Direct.	 Don't	 ask	 her	 opinion	 about	 this.	 Don't	 ask, 'Okay?'	In	fact,	don't ask anything.	We	don't	want	to	give	her	the	opportunity to	say	no.

You	will	be	home all	day	today .	Your	child	will	be naked	all	day .	Now,	many people	tell	me	that	their	child	hates	to	be	naked.	Be	that	as	it	may,	you	really	do need	to	have	your	child	bottomless,	at	the	very	least.	Much	of	the	day	is	going to	consist	of	you	catching	your	child	midpee	and	getting	him	to	the	potty.	If	he has	any	covering	on	his	bum,	by	the	time	you	see	the	pee,	it	will	be	too	latehis	 bladder	will	have	emptied.	The	other	benefit	to	keeping	your	child	naked today	is	that	you	will	be	more	likely	to	see	her	signals	when	she	is	naked.	Every kid	gives	some	sort	of	signal	right	before	she	pees.	It	may	be	very	subtle,	but	it's there.

I	suggest	extra	fluids	today.	Usually	a	couple	of	juice	boxes	will	do	the	trick. I'm	not	a	fan	of	juice	boxes,	but	they're	great	for	this	first	block	of	learning.	You can	also	have	melon,	other	fruits,	and	ice	pops.	These	all	count	as	fluids.

If	your	child	is	younger	than	twenty-four	months,	you	should	not	push	extra	fluids. I	have	no	idea	why,	but	kids	under	twenty-four	months	can't	handle	the	extra intake.	Just	give	normal	amounts	of	liquid	to	these	little	ones.

The	idea	behind	the	extra	fluid	is	to	get	a	bit	of	practice	in.	Normally,	your child	 may	 pee	 around	 five	 times	 a	 day.	 We	 want	 to	 bump	 that	 up	 a	 bit,	 just temporarily.

A	 word	 of	 caution:	 if	 your	 child	 is	 sucking	 down	 fluids-I	 mean,	 like	 a ridiculous	amount-it	will	backfire	on	you.	His	system	will	be	so	out	of	whack that	he	won't	be	able	to	do	any	serious	learning.	If	this	starts	to	happen,	slow down	with	the	extra	liquid.

Elisa's	mom,	a	former	client,	contacted	me	almost	in	tears.	The	first	day	of potty	training,	Elisa	went	gangbusters	on	the	fluids	and	pretty	much	was	peeing as	she	was	drinking.	While	it	made	for	a	funny	visual,	this	is	too	much	liquid. Look	for	the	happy	medium.	We	want	more	fluid	than	usual,	but	not	tons.	All we	are	looking	for	is	pee	practice.

Now,	let	me	assure	you,	this	is	going	to	be	the	most	exhausting	day	of	your life.	No,	I'm	serious.	Your	job	today	is	to do	nothing	but	watch	your	child .	 If	 this sounds	unbearable,	remember	the	pot	of	gold	at	the	end	of	the	rainbow!	Still,	I cannot	 stress this enough: TODAY	 YOU	 WILL	 DO	 NOTHING	 BUT WATCH	YOUR	CHILD!

Have	fun	projects	planned.	Play	trains	and	dolls	and	puzzles.	Watch	videos, read	stories,	dance	around	naked.	Let	the	dishes	go,	don't	vacuum	or	dust,	don't do	laundry.	You	will	be	on	your	child	like	white	on	rice.	No	computer!	Don't get	on	the	phone!	Don't	read	a	magazine	or	book!

I	 can't	tell	you	how	many	parents	tell	me	it	went	wrong	from	the	first	day. 'She	just	peed	on	the	floor.'	I'll	go	through	the	day	with	them	and	learn	that Mom	just	'had	to'	get	on	the	phone	because	of	this,	that,	or	the	other	thing,	or 'had	to'	check	her	email.	You	have	to	watch	your	child	and	help	her	get	to	the potty.	She	is	not	yet	able	to	pick	up	on	her	need	to	pee	without	your	help.	If there	is	some	pressing	matter	in	your	life-someone's	in	the	hospital,	you're	on call,	etc.then	don't	pick	this	day	to	potty	train!

One	way	to	make	this	exhausting	day	sound	easier	in	your	own	mind	is	to think	of	it	as	a	great	bonding	opportunity.	For	me	personally,	after	the	first	day of	potty	training,	I	felt	closer	to	my	son	than	I	had	in	months.	I	felt	a	bond	akin to	that	of	breast-feeding	again.	Let's	face	it;	around	eighteen	months,	our	kids start	 showing	 some	 independence,	 and	 we're	 thrilled!	 For	 the	 first	 time	 since birth,	we	can	maybe	sit	for	a	moment	with	a	cup	of	coffee	and	read	an	article. We	very	rarely	watch	every	move	our	child	makes.	The	house	has	been	childproofed,	he	can	walk	without	killing	himself,	and	we	get	a	breather.	Think	of this	 day	 as	 a	 special	 opportunity	 to	 reconnect.	 I	 remember	 being	 surprised. There	were	all	these	little	things	he	would	do	that	I	hadn't	seen.	Also,	I	figured out	what	was	happening	to	all	the	damn	Legos	(stacked	way	under	the	couch cushions;	who	knew	he	had	a	secret	stash?).

One	 mom	 reported	 to	 me,	 'We	 had	 SUCH	 a	 blast	 that	 first	 day!	 It	 was almost	decadent	to	get	to	stay	home	and	just	focus	on	him	all	day	and	not	rush around	doing	things.	We	played	all	kinds	of	games,	it	was	just	so	fun,	and	he	did so	great.	I	was	so	impressed	with	him!'	What	I	really	loved	about	this	mom	was how	impressed	she	was	by	her	son,	though	the	way	I	see	things,	it	took	both	of them	working	together	to	make	that	first	day	of	potty	training	successful.

Let's	break	this	day	down	into	minutiae,	starting	with	that	first	pee.	If	you're doing	your	job, which	is	watching	your	child ,	you'll	catch	that	pee	quickly.	Don't panic,	don't	scream.	Just	say	something	like,	'Oo,	oo,	hold	it,	honey	.	.	.'	Pick your	child	up	and	get	him	to	the	potty	ASAP.	Hopefully,	you'll	make	it	in	time for	some	of	the	pee	to	go	in	the	pot	(yes,	you	will	leave	a	trail	of	pee	behind). Once	the	pee	is	in	the	pot,	you	have	lots	of	options,	depending	on	your	child. You	can	high	five,	 dance	 around,	 have	 him	 look	 at	 it	 and	 empty	 it,	 you	 can make	a	big	deal	out	of	it,	or	you	can	just	say,	'Thank	you'	or	'Wow.	You	did	it.' Don't	make	the	rush	to	the	pot	frantic	or	scary-just	quick.	I	suggest	keeping the	potty	nearby	at	all	times.

You	are	not	to	ask	you	child	if	she	has	to	go .	Never,	in	the	coming	week,	will	you ask	your	child	if	she	has	to	go.	You	will	prompt	her	by	saying	something	like, 'Come.	It's	time	to	pee.'

So,	 back	 to	 that	 first	 pee.	 Honestly,	 I've	 seen	 greater	 success	 from	 parents who	wait	for	the	first	pee	to	start	and	then	run	the	kid	to	the	pot	than	from parents	who	randomly	sit	the	kid	on	the	pot	to	try	to	pee.	Do	you	understand the	difference?	Some	people	maintain	that	if	you	just	put	your	child	on	the	pot every	half	hour	or	so,	eventually	they'll	pee.	A	lot	of	day	cares	train	this	way.	It can	work,	but	I've	found	it's	more	effective	to	wait	for	the	child	to	start	peeing and	then	get	him	to	the	toilet.	I	think	this	is	because	he	makes	the	connection between	 'feeling'	 and	 'doing'	 faster	 this	 way.	 Just	 sitting	 on	 the	 potty	 and waiting	for	the	pee	doesn't	allow	him	to	connect	the	dots	as	quickly.

Over	the	course	of	the	next	few	pees,	one	of	two	things	will	happen:	either your	child	won't	recognize	that	he's	peeing	(still	'clueless'),	or	your	child	will notice	that	he's	peed	or	he's	peeing.	Most	kids	skip	directly	to	the	'I'm	peeing' stage,	which	is	typically	characterized	by	a	funny	look	on	his	face.	This	look	is part	interest-there's	a	certain	fascination	for	him	in	watching	himself	pee,	to be	sure-but	he'll	also	probably	look	at	you	like	a	deer	in	the	headlights.	'Uhoh	.	.	.	what	the	hell	am	I	supposed	to	do	now?'	Keep	an	eye	out	for	this	look. Often	it	comes	right	before	the	pee,	and	it	can	help	you	get	your	child	to	the toilet	in	time.

The	first	day	proceeds.	By	the	third	pee,	she'll	probably	know	it's	coming	one to	two	seconds	before	it	actually	starts.	Rush	to	the	potty.	Each	time	she	pees, she'll	know	a	little	further	in	advance,	which	will	buy	you	a	bit	more	time	to	get her	to	the	potty.	Watching	your	child	closely	this	first	day	will	also	give	you	an idea	of	what	kind	of	pee-er	you	have.	Some	kids	do	five	little	pees	after	taking	in some	fluid;	others	wait	an	hour	and	then	do	one	huge	pee.

Being	 naked,	 your	 child	 may	 very	 quickly	 catch	 on	 and	 sit	 by	 himself.	 A quick	note	about	boys:	definitely	have	him	sit	down	to	pee	for	now.	Hold	his penis	 down	for	him	and	tell	him	what	you're	doing	to	teach	him	how.	Don't have	him	attempt	standing	and	aiming	yet.

Somewhere	 in	 Block	 One,	 you	 should	 start	 to	 get	 good	 at	 noticing	 'that look'	 in	 your	 child's	 eyes,	 which	 is	 generally	 accompanied	 by	 some	 sort	 of physical	 signal	 that	 you'll	 begin	 to	 recognize.	 You	 may	 see	 him	 standing perfectly	still	or	stop	playing.	He	may	or	may	not	signal	with	his	hands	and/or words.	When	you	see	the	look	and/or	signal,	help	him	get	to	the	potty.	Are	you seeing	how	this	day	works?	Again,	with	all	the	fluids	he's	drinking,	there	should be	a	fair	number	of	pees.	Even	if	your	child	is	a	camel,	though,	remember:	no asking	if	he	has	to	go.	Just	prompt	him	every	so	often.	Expect	success.	Most	kids I've	worked	with	'get	it'	remarkably	fast.	You	may	even	be	getting	a	few	seconds heads-up	that	the	pee	is	coming.

The	first	several	pees	may	not	go	in	the	exact	order	described	here.	It	may take	your	child	a	few	pees	before	you	get	that	extra	second	or	so	of	warning.	Just remember	the	general	idea	is	to	increase	your	child's	awareness	to	the	point	that she	can	tell	you	before	she	has	to	go.

If	you're	not	seeing	this	progression	of	awareness,	it's	okay.	I	repeat:	it's	okay. It's	really	hard	to	determine	how	well	things	are	going	in	these	first	few	days.	It's very	common	to	have	what	looks	like	a	disaster	in	the	first	two	or	three	days, and	 then	 have	 things	 magically	 click	 into	 place.	 Still,	 if	 you're	 worried	 that there	is	no	progress,	it's	worth	taking	a	minute	to	check	in	with	yourself.	Are you	truly	watching	your	child,	or	have	you	gotten	distracted?	Are	you	making too	 big	 a	 deal	 of	 all	 this?	 There	 is	 a	 delicate	 balance	 between	 prompting	 and backing	off.	Remember,	potty	training	should	be	an	effort	for	you,	but	not	for your	child.	Are	you	hounding	her?	In	your	child's	mind,	today	should	be	about special	one-on-one	time	with	Mom	and/or	Dad	and	learning	a	new	skill.	Don't let	 drama	 and	 your	 nervousness	 take	 over.	 Children	 resist	 when	 there's	 too much	pressure.	As	with	parenting	in	general,	in	potty	training	if	you	are	met with	resistance,	you	must	examine	your	own	actions.	I'm	not	placing	blame;	it's just	 that	 sometimes	 we	 don't	 realize	 the	 pressure	 we're	 putting	 on	 our	 kids. Remember,	pressure	can	be	either	verbal	or	nonverbal,	and	kids	are	masters	at picking	up	your	nonverbal	cues.

Few,	if	any,	kids	go	straight	from	this	first	day	of	potty	training	into	telling you	with	words	that	they	have	to	pee	or	poop.	This	is	important	to	remember.	A lot	of	parents	expect	that	the	verbal	indication	will	happen	sooner	than	it	does and	are	befuddled	by	the	number	of	accidents	their	child	has.	From	start	date	to self-initiation	 usually	 takes	 about	 three	 weeks	 for	 most	 kids,	 even	 superverbal communicators.

As	for	that	first	poop,	remember	how	weird	it	is	going	to	feel	to	your	child, who	is	used	to	pooping	in	a	diaper.	My	advice,	as	with	pee,	is	to	wait	for	it	to come	 rather	 than	 using	 the	 ''sitting and	 trying' routine. Signals of an impending	 poop	 to	 watch	 for	 are	 an	 intense	 look	 of	 concentration,	 grunting, twitching,	indicating	physical	discomfort,	rubbing	the	belly,	sudden	crankiness, and	retreating	to	a	corner,	under	the	table,	or	some	private	place.	You	then	put your	child	on	the	pot.	I	really	do	suggest	the	little	pot;	the	squat	used	to	sit	down will	help	ease	the	poop	out.	Have	wipes/TP	handy,	grab	a	favorite	book	or	two, and	get	comfortable.	Read	the	stories	to	your	child.	If	he	grunts	and	screws	up his	 face,	 just	 grunt	 along	 with	 him.	 Without	 overtalking,	 you	 can	 softly	 offer encouragement	 (I	 say	 softly	 because	 this	 is	 sort	 of	 an	 inward	 function).	 'It's coming,	you	can	do	it.	Uhh.	Go	ahead,	honey,	let	it	out.'

Encourage	but	don't	pressure.	If	your	child	gets	freaked	out	and	starts	to	cry, keep	her	on	the	pot	and	just	hug	her.	Look	her	in	the	eyes	if	that	helps	hersome	kids	really	need	you	to	look	them	in	the	eyes	if	they're	having	a	hard	time, though	when	things	are	progressing	normally,	most	kids	prefer	not	to	be	stared down-and	let	her	know	it's	okay.	If	she's	having	trouble,	it	could	be	that	the poop	is	hard,	or	she	could	just	be	freaked	out.	For	the	first	few	poops-most	kids will	go	down	to	pooping	once	a	day-you	may	have	to	read	to	her	for	a	while. That's	normal.	Also,	this	is	a	suggestion	I'll	mention	throughout	the	book	that you	can	start	with	the	first	poop,	so	it	becomes	routine:	put	some	thick	books under	 your	 child's	 feet.	 We	 want	 her	 thighs	 as	 close	 to	 her	 chest	 as	 possible. This	will	mimic	the	squat	position	she	knows	and	loves.	It	also	physically	helps the	poop	come	out	better.

Have	your	 child	 carry	 the	 little	 pot	 to	 dump	 in	 the	 big	 toilet.	 This	 is	 the reward.	Let	me	tell	you,	most	kids	will love it!	He'll	be	so	proud	and	amazed	at this	poop,	as	well	he	should	be.	If	it	works	for	your	child,	give	him	more	verbal praise	 and	 high	 fives.	 I	 also	 recommend	 helping	 your	 child	 connect	 'feeling' with	'doing.'	'Wow,	your	belly	must	feel	GOOD	after	that	HUGE	poop!'	I've found	that	kids	respond	well	to	adjectives	and	exclamations	like,	'huge,'	'tons,' 'wow,'	'my	goodness,'	etc.-basically	anything	with	an	exclamation	point!

## Praise

There	 are	 a	 few	 different	 theories	 on	 praise.	 Some	 parents	 don't	 believe	 in praising	at	all.	 They'd	rather	have	their	child	develop	an	inner	sense	of	pride than	depend	upon	external	reinforcement.	I	personally	think	a	'good	job'	once in	a	while	is	fine,	though	in	my	own	parenting,	I	try	not	to	say	it	over	and	over just	for	something	to	say.	If	you	don't	feel	comfortable	praising	your	child,	you can	always	'reflect'	back	to	them	with	no	judgment.	This	would	look	like,	'Oh. You	peed	on	the	floor,'	or	'You	peed	in	the	potty.'	Either	praising	or	reflecting is	 fine.	 I	 do	 think,	since	there	really	is	only	one	desirable	outcome,	that	there should	be something in	your	voice	that	says	'Yay'	this	or	'No'	that.	This	often gets	overlooked	if	you	are	someone	who	doesn't	want	to	praise.	You	do	have	to let	your	child	know,	in	some	manner,	that	peeing	on	the	floor	is	'not	good'	and on	the	potty	is	'good.'	I	don't	recommend	those	words,	but	you	must	find	a	way to	convey	the	notion	because	otherwise,	you're	teaching	your	child	that	it's	okay to	pee	wherever,	which	is	not	what	potty	training	is	about.	I'm	particularly	fond of	 having	the	parent	say,	'You	did	it,'	and/or	having	the	child	say,	'I	did	it!' This	gives	the	success	over	to	your	child	as	theirs	and,	for	some	kids,	has	more impact	than	standard	praise	or	mirroring.

## Poop

Poop	 is	 a	 huge	 deal.	 HUGE.	 So	 huge,	 it's	 got	 its	 own	 chapter	 (the	 longest chapter	 in	 this	 book,	 actually).	 For	 now,	 though,	 let's	 just	 address	 the	 single biggest	poop	question	I	get,	which	is	what	to	do	if	you	missed	the	poop	or	your child	didn't	poop	at	all	on	the	first	day	of	potty	training.

Most	kids	show	some	sort	of	sign	that	they	are	about	to	poop,	but	some	can drop	 it	 like	 it's	 hot.	 If	 you	 miss	 the	 poop	 that	 first	 day,	 it's	 okay-the	 whole process	doesn't	fall	apart.	Get	back	on	the	horse.	Don't	let	it	undermine	your confidence.	 Clean	 it	 up	 and	 say	 something	 simple	 and	 to	 the	 point.	 This	 is where	reflecting	back	to	the	child	is	really	helpful:	'You	pooped	on	the	floor. Poop	goes	in	the	potty.	Sit	on	the	potty	to	poop.'	Simple	and	direct.	You	don't want	 to	 scold	 your	 child	 on	 this	 first	 day,	 but	 it's	 very	 important	 that	 you communicate	in	tone,	voice,	and	body	language	what	you	expect.	This	concept is	brand-new,	and	your	child	needs	to	learn	the	rules	of	the	game.	Don't	use	the words	 'It's	 okay'	 if	 poop	 ends	 up	 on	 the	 floor.	 For	 some	 kids,	 those	 specific words	imply	permission.

If	your	child	doesn't	poop	at	all	on	this	first	day,	or	if	she	normally	poops	in the	morning	and	doesn't	today,	it's	okay.	Again,	we'll	be	looking	at	poop	very closely	soon	enough.	Pooping	behavior	generally	changes	during	potty	training. When	wearing	a	diaper,	most	children	poop	as	many	as	three	or	more	times	a day.	During	potty	training,	that	typically	goes	down	to	about	one	poop	a	day.	I don't	 know	 why	 this	 is.	 I	 suspect	 it's	 a	 natural	 consolidation	 and	 part	 of socialization.	I	mean,	who	has	time	to	sit	and	poop	three	times	a	day,	you	know?

Anyway,	 if	 your	 child	 doesn't	 poop	 (or	 doesn't	 poop	 at	 the	 normal	 time) today,	 it's	 nothing	 to	 be	 concerned	 with.	 As	 for	 holding	 poop,	 yes,	 it	 can	 be uncomfortable,	but	most	children	can	go	longer	than	you	would	think	without	a poop	before	most	pediatricians	will	even	blink.	Your	child	is	in	no	danger	if	he holds	it	for	a	day	or	two.	I	want	to	remind	you	again	that	your	vibe	is	running the	show.	If	you	are	freaked	out	or	overly	anxious	about	getting	a	poop	out	of your	child,	he	will	hold	it.	The	best	thing	to	do	is	to	act	supercasual	and	assume the	poop	is	(eventually)	coming.

A	few	notes	about	'accidents'	in	Block	One.	Any	pee/poop	that	ends	up	on the	floor	is	not	an	accident	at	this	point;	it's	a	learning	tool.	Have	your	child help	clean	up	and	don't	scold	her.	Use	positive	but	simple	language.	'You	are learning.	You	pooped	on	the	floor.	Next	time,	your	poop	goes	in	the	potty.'

Another	thing	many	parents	don't	know	is	that	pee	is	sterile.	You	can	drink your	 own	 pee.	 I	 know	 .	 .	 .	 why	 would	 you	 want	 to?	 But	 you	 can.	 A	 quick tangent:	I	used	to	be	a	trapeze	artist.	We	would	regularly	lose	big	areas	of	skin	on our	 hands	 and	 legs	 to	 the	 bar.	 The	 fastest	 way	 to	 heal?	 Pee	 on	 it.	 I'm	 not kidding.	Pee	would	heal	up	the	skin	in	about	a	day.	I	performed	with	a	girl	who saved	her	pee	and	would	bathe	in	it.	Gross,	right?	Her	skin	was	flawless,	though. All	by	way	of	saying,	yes,	there	really	are	freaky	circus	people	and,	no,	you	don't have	to	be	afraid	of	pee.

Okay,	now	it's	nap	time	on	day	one.	You	will	still	use	diapers	for	naps	(and bedtime),	but	you	will	now	clearly	and	directly	tell	your	child	what	is	going	on: 'I'm	going	to	put	a	diaper	on	you	for	nap	because	you're	still	learning.	You've done	such	a	good	job	today,	and	your	nap	is	a	long	time.	You	may	not	remember to	 pee	 when	 you're	 sleeping.	 When	 you	 wake	 up,	 we're	 going	 to	 take	 it	 right off.'

You've	 stated	 it	 clearly	 so	 your	 child	 knows	 what	 to	 expect	 and	 why.	 No child	 I	 have	 ever	 worked	 with	 has	 ever	 questioned	 this.	 It's	 like	 they	 know they'll	be	asleep	and	not	in	control	of	things.	I've	also	never	had	a	child	bring up	 the	 fact	 that	 just	 four	 hours	 ago	 we	 made	 a	 big	 deal	 of	 throwing	 out	 said diapers.	I	would	make	sure	to	have	a	go	at	a	pee	before	a	nap.

I	 used	to	suggest	holding	off	on	the	nap	if	you	hadn't	gotten	a	poop	in	the morning	hours.	 This	 is	 ultimately	 your	 call,	 as	 you	 know	 your	 child's	 routine best.	If	you	suspect	a	poop	is	brewing,	you	can	slightly	delay	the	nap,	but	I've come	to	the	conclusion	that	having	a	tired	child	is	the	quickest	way	to	derail potty	training.	So	don't	hold	off	on	the	nap	for	too	long.	We	need	your	child rested.	 If	 he	 does	 poop	 in	 the	 naptime	 diaper,	 it's	 okay	 for	 the	 moment.	 If	 it becomes	a	habit,	we	will	have	to	deal	with	it,	but	for	the	first	few	days,	it's	okay. Typically,	 the	 child	 isn't	 holding	 the	 poop	 in	 specifically	 for	 the	 nap	 diaper. Rather,	there's	been	a	lot	to	learn,	and	as	he	relaxes	during	sleep,	the	poop	just comes	naturally.	You	should	dispose	of	the	poopy	diaper	as	you	normally	would.

I	do	not	suggest	you	let	your	child	dump	the	contents	of	his	diaper	in	the	toilet. The	 entire	 process	 of	 potty	 training	 is	 teaching	 your	 child	 that	 his	 bodily functions	go	in	the	toilet.	For	him	to	do	it	in	his	diaper	and	then	dump	that	is not	the	connection	we	are	looking	for	your	child	to	make.

After	 nap,	 continue	 on	 with	 the	 day	 the	 way	 it's	 been.	 You'll	 probably	 be exhausted.	That's	normal.	Your	child	may	be	exhausted.	That's	also	okay.	Your kid's	had	to	learn	a	lot	about	something	she	paid	no	attention	to	until	a	short while	 ago.	 Many	 children	 may	 seem	 more	 needy	 or	 clingy.	 If	 you	 are	 still nursing,	 your	 child	 will	 probably	 want	 to	 nurse	 more.	 This	 is	 all	 okay	 and expected.

I	wouldn't	put	any	sort	of	thought	into	whether	the	nap/bedtime	diapers	are wet	or	dry.	If	your	child	has	shown	progress	during	the	day,	a	wet	diaper	means nothing.	As	your	child	gets	better	at	holding	it	till	he	reaches	the	pot,	he	will naturally	start	staying	dry.	The	good	news	is	this	happens	in	a	short	period	of time.	(I	will	address	actual	night	training	at	the	end	of	this	chapter.)	Also,	in the	 beginning	 phases	 of	 potty	 training,	 he	 may	 not	 yet	 be	 fully	 emptying	 his bladder,	so	nap	and	night	diapers	may	be	fuller	than	usual.	This	evens	out	with time	and	practice.

If	you	intend	to	give	up	all	diapers,	even	for	naps	and	nighttime,	be	sure	to read	the	beginning	of	chapter	6,	'Nighttime	Training.'	It's	actually	a	better	way to	potty	train,	but	I	understand	that	it	can	look	overwhelming	to	attempt.

If	you	partake	in	alcohol,	please	have	some	wine	at	the	end	of	this	day.	It	is also	acceptable	to	have	wine	in	your	cereal	when	potty	training.	You	deserve	it.

After	this	first	day	of	potty	training,	you	should	have	a	relatively	good	idea	of when	and	how	often	your	child	needs	to	use	the	potty.	More	important,	your child	should	have	a	relatively	good	idea	of	when,	where,	and	how	to	pee.

Chances	are	Block	One	has	left	you	either	elated	or	bummed.	You	may	be stoked	that	you	and	your	child	both	have	a	good	handle	on	this	potty	training thing,	 or	 you	 may	 be	 feeling	 like	 your	 child	 absolutely	 didn't	 get	 it.	 If	 you're feeling	 like	 this	 first	 day	 didn't	 prove	 so	 successful,	 examine	 where	 and	 when things	might	have	gotten	tripped	up.	Check	in	and	be	honest	with	yourself	on what	you	may	have	done	to	hamper	the	process.	I	really	encourage	you	to	look at	your	own	behavior	during	potty	training	rather	than	putting	it	solely	on	your child.	Many	parents	have	told	me	that	their	child	is	too	intense,	too	stubborn, or	too	something,	but-and	I	say	this	without	judgment-usually	these	parents tend	to	be	the	same.	So	not	only	have	the	parents	passed	this	trait	on	to	the child,	but	they	(the	parents)	act	this	way	during	the	process	of	potty	training. Know	 your	 own	 style	 and	 be	 willing	 to	 adjust	 accordingly.	 Try	 to	 strike	 the careful	 balance	 of	 being	 extremely	 attentive	 without	 being	 overreactive	 or overbearing.

At	this	point	I	also	feel	it's	worth	mentioning	a	particular	phenomenon	I	see as	 a	 mom	and	as	a	potty	trainer.	Parenting	has	gotten	oddly	competitive	in	a strange	way.	Most	of	us	know	it's	not	healthy	to	push	our	children	to	see	who can	read	sooner	and	who	can	spell	or	do	whatever	else	better.	Still,	there's	an odd	thing	happening	that	I	don't	even	think	most	parents	are	aware	of,	which	is a	sort	of	reverse	competitiveness.	It's	as	though	parents	are	competing	to	have the	child	who	is	most	special	because	of	a	negative:	he	refuses	sleep,	she's	always sick,	he's	so	intense,	she's	never	done	what	everyone	else	does,	he	never	lets	me eat,	and	so	on.	Please	don't	make	your	child	special	for	not	potty	training.	It's	an area	where	it's	just	fine	to	be	average.	In	fact,	go	in	the	other	direction.	If	your kid's	going	to	be	special,	let	him	be	special	for	doing	it	quickly	and	easily.

In	any	event,	should	you	feel	your	child	really	hasn't	gotten	the	gist	of	potty training	 after	 the	 first	 day,	 that's	 okay.	 Our	 twenty-four-hour	 system	 dictates that	you	move	on	to	day	two,	but	it's	totally	fine	if	you're	still	in	Block	One	as far	as	learning	goes.	Blocks	are	defined	by	progress	made,	not	by	time	passed.	I can't	state	this	enough: every	child	is	different .	Remember	that	timeline	we	talked about?	Clueless	to	I	Peed	to	I'm	Peeing	to	I	Have	to	Go	Pee?	Look	for	progress, not	perfection.	Nothing	is	really	a	problem	on	these	first	few	days.	It's	vital	to remember	how	new	this	is	to	your	child.	We	cannot	expect	them	to	'get	it'	just because	we	say	it,	and	this	whole	thing	is	a	process,	okay?	If	they	need	a	little more	time	on	Block	One,	that's	fine.

For	 subsequent	 days	 in	 Block	 One,	 you	 will	 go	 back	 to	 normal	 fluid consumption	and	work	on	getting	the	pee	in	the	potty.

End	result:	A	successful	completion	of	Block	One	should	look	something	along the	lines	of	your	child,	while	naked,	can	sit	to	pee	and	poop	on	the	potty.	This can	be	because	you	prompted,	you	led	him,	or	he	went	on	his	own. If	you	do	not see	this,	you	are	still	on	Block	One	and	should	not	move	on	until	you	see	a	successful completion	of	the	end	result. Don't	expect	perfection,	but	you	should	have	a	sense of	your	child	starting	to	'get	it.'	The	biggest	indicator	of	'getting	it'	is	how you feel.	You	may	be	tired,	yes,	but	you	should	feel	hopeful.	If	you	are	disappointed or	even	devastated,	your	child	simply	needs	more	time	on	Block	One,	and	that's fine. Block	One	normally	takes	anywhere	from	one	to	three	days.

As	soon	as	you	get	a	sense	of	hope	or	that	a	lightbulb	has	lit	up	in	your	child's head,	it's	time	to	move	on	to	clothes.	You	don't	want	to	stay	in	Block	One	too long.	That	can	result	in	an	'Only	Potty	Trained	When	Naked'	kid,	and	unless you	live	in	a	nudist	colony,	that's	not	really	potty	trained.	Again,	Block	One doesn't	have	to	be	absolutely	perfect.	Move	on	when	you	have	an	overall	sense of	progress.

We	are	paying	more	attention	to	blocks	than	days	here,	BUT,	but,	but	.	.	. most	often	the	second	day	of	potty	training,	whatever	block	of	learning	you	are on,	 can	 bring	 resistance.	 We	 will	 discuss	 this	 in	 chapters	 7	 ('Block	 One Drama')	and	8	('Block	Two	and	Three	Dilemmas')	more	fully,	but	I	want	to give	you	a	heads-up	early	on.	By	day	two,	the	fun	is	gone,	you	are	serious	about full-time	potty	use,	and	your	child	is	over	it	.	.	.	and	cranks	up	the	resistance. Expect	it.	It's	normal,	and	we'll	bust	through	it	when	it	happens.

## Block	Two

This	block	still	requires	your	watchful	eye.	What	we	are	most	looking	for	is	to get	your	child	in	clothes.	Both	you	and	your	child	should	have	a	sense	of	when the	pee	is	happening	when	you	start	this	block.	Again,	it's	not	likely	going	to	be in	 words.	 Whether	 with	 a	 look	 or	 a	 pee-pee	 dance,	 it	 should	 look	 like	 a lightbulb	 of	 sorts	 is	 going	 off	 in	 your	 child's	 head,	 even	 if	 they	 indicate	 it	 by crying	or	noticing	if	they	don't	make	it	to	the	potty.	That	recognition	is	good!

## Commando

Your	child	should	go	commando	(aka,	no	underpants	but	with	pants)	for	about	a month,	give	or	take	a	week.	I	used	to	merely	suggest	this,	but	over	the	years	I've come	to	the	conclusion	that	it	is	a	very	necessary	step.	Underpants	are	too	much like	a	diaper.	A	few	days	of	potty	training	is	not	long	enough	to	reprogram	your child's	muscle	memory.	That	muscle	memory	dictates	that	when	something	snug goes on, it's time	 to release the pee	 and	 poop.	 Because	 this	 is largely unconscious,	 it's	 beyond	 your	 child's	 scope	 to	 control	 it.	 In	 other	 words,	 she can't	be	expected	to	do	anything but poop	and	pee	in	the	underpants.

Because they fit snugly, underpants somewhat contain an accident, particularly	a	poop.	While	this	may	seem	advantageous,	it's	not;	I've	seen	kids have	accidents	in	underpants	and	not	be	too	bothered	by	it.	However,	because going	 commando	 feels	 similar	 to	 being	 naked,	 an	 accident	 in	 pants	 with	 no underpants	feels	much	different.	To	be	honest,	it	feels	much	grosser.	The	pee trickles	 down	their	legs,	and	their	pants	get	all	stuck	to	them.	That's	good	in potty	training.	Kids	seem	to	have	a	sense	of	shame	when	an	accident	happens while	 going	 commando	 that	 they	 don't	 really	 feel	 during	 an	 accident	 with underpants.	 I	 think	 this	 may	 be	 because	 kids	 see	 underpants	 as	 a	 diaper	 in another	form.	When	I	say	a	sense	of	shame,	I'm	not	suggesting	that	you	shame your	child;	I	don't	advocate	that.	There	is,	however,	a	natural	sense	of	shame that	develops	during	the	process	of	socialization,	and	an	internal	sense	of	shame is	 an	indication	that	socialization	is	occurring	appropriately.	Any	child	can	go without	underpants	under	shorts	or	pants,	and	on	girls,	no	undies	under	a	dress is	perfect.

Another	possible	reason	that	kids	seem	to	have	more	accidents	early	in	potty training	if	they're	wearing	undies:	underpants	afford	a	certain	level	of	privacy.	If the	genitals	are	all	tucked	away	nicely,	it	seems	to	the	child	as	though	you	can't see	them	having	an	accident,	which	reduces	the	internal	sense	of	shame.

As	for	cleanliness,	going	commando	is	fine	hygienically.	If	you	find	you	have a	strong	reaction	to	this	suggestion,	ask	yourself	why.	I've	never	seen	a	kid	get an	infection	or	anything	like	that,	which	some	parents	fear.	Still,	many	parents are	freaked	out	by	this	suggestion.	If	you	are,	I'd	venture	to	say	you	are	going	to have	a	hard	time	potty	training.	Underpants	are	a	layer	of	fabric-nothing	else. Pants	are	a	layer	of	fabric.	Going	without	underpants	is	not	a	big	deal	and	can save	you	lots	of	frustration.	When	I	hear	a	parent	get	wiggly	about	commando,	it makes	 me	 think	 they	 have	 some	 weirdness	 about	 genitals	 and	 pottying	 in general.	Neither	hang-up	will	help	in	the	potty	training	process.	Day	cares	and commando	are	another	ball	of	crappy	wax	entirely.	I'll	address	that	in	chapter 12,	'Day	Cares	and	Other	Caregivers.'

## What's	the	deal	with	training	pants?

Training	pants	is	actually	a	THING.	Training	pants	are	underwear	with	a	triple layer	of	cloth	in	the	crotch.	Training	pants	went	out	of	fashion	for	a	couple	of decades	when	the	big	diaper	companies	showed	their	claws	with	pull-ups.

Training	 pants	 are	 useful when	 it's	 time	 to	 move	 to	 underpants .	 They	 are	 a version	of	underpants.

I	 quote	 a	 client:	 'To	 all	 you	 moms	 out	 there,	 when	 Jamie	 tells	 you	 to	 do things	a	certain	way,	it's	based	on	a	lot	of	experience,	so	you	should	listen	to her!	I	tried	the	training	pants	again	on	day	five	when	we	visited	my	mom.	Six accidents	in	four	hours!	The	next	day,	back	to	commando,	&amp;	either	no	or	one small	pee	accident.	She's	doing	so	great	now!'

If you're still digging in your heels about	 commando,	 go	 ahead-try underpants	if	commando	totally	weirds	you	out.	But	if	your	child	starts	having accidents	left	and	right?	Well,	I	told	you	so.

After	a	few	weeks	or	so,	your	child	should	be	able	to	start	using	underpants without	 any	 problems.	 If	 you	 have	 tempted	 your	 child	 with	 fancy	 character underpants,	or	if	your	child	knows	about	underpants,	you	should	hide	them	for now	to	avoid	any	fights	about	it.	If	your	child begs for	undies,	you	can	give	them a	 go.	 Some	kids	have	a	superhigh	integrity	about	not	peeing	on	their	favorite characters,	if	you	chose	character	undies.	If	it	works	for	you,	go	for	it.	If	not,	be willing	to	ditch	them	fast.

Also	worth	noting:	you'll	be	ditching	onesies,	overalls,	footie	pajamas,	and pants	or	shorts	with	complicated	buttons	and	snaps.	It	seems	obvious,	but	I	find it	 often	 slips	 parents'	 minds.	 I	 highly	 suggest	 elastic	 waistbands,	 at	 least	 for	 a while.	Your	child	is	still	only	going	to	give	you	a	five-to	ten-second	heads-up,	so you	need	to	be	quick	about	getting	the	pants	down.	Plus,	you	want	to	make	it easy	for	your	child	to	do	it	herself	if	she	wants	to.	If	your	child	is	hindered	by	her clothes	and	can't	make	it	to	the	potty	in	time	to	pee,	chances	are	she	will	feel really	 embarrassed	 and	 have	 a	 meltdown.	 Set	 yourself	 and	 your	 child	 up	 for nothing	but	success.

One	more	note	about	underpants,	commando,	and	the	whole	shebang: pullups	 are	 diapers,	 plain	 and	 simple. I	 have	 no	 use	 for	 them.	 They	 prolong	 potty training	 indefinitely.	 No	 child	 uses	 pull-ups	 as	 underpants.	 And	 if	 underpants feel	 too	 much	like	a	diaper,	what	do	pull-ups	feel	like?	A	diaper.	Don't	waste your	time	or	money.

So	Block	Two	brings	clothes.	It	also	combines	with	Block	Three	and	brings small	outings.	These	should	be	planned	and	will	give	you	a	sense	of	how	leaving the	 house	 potty	 trained	 differs	 from	 leaving	 the	 house	 with	 diapers.	 Early	 on, though,	 these	 should	 be	 small-I	 repeat,	 small-outings!	 Do	 not	 attempt	 a week's	grocery	shopping.	Do	not	attempt	an	hour	drive	to	Grandma's.	Don't	go to	story	time	at	the	library	thinking	you'll	show	off	your	child's	new	skill.	Do	not try	to	complete	a	necessary	chore.	Instead,	consider	a	walk	around	the	block	or	a run	to	a	store	for	just	one	item.	These	small	outings	are	practice	runs.

It	is	normal	for	you	child	to	wet	a	few	pairs	of	pants.	The	first	couple	of	pees, your	child	may	wet	all	the	way	through	the	pants.	Don't	be	devastated.	Have them	help	you	get	new	clothes	and	clean	up.	This	is	common,	but	I	regularly have	moms	contacting	me	who	are	practically	in	tears	that	their	child	 is	 not getting	it.	We	have	no	idea	how	he's	processing	the	information	you've	given him.	 Kids	 do	 not	 and	 cannot	 just	 up	 and	 do	 something	 new	 because	 we	 ask them	to.	For	all	we	know,	he's	processing	the	information	and	at	any	moment, he'll	discover	the	right	order	of	things.

You	will	still	be	using	diapers	for	naps	and	bedtime	during	Block	Two.	Again, clearly	state	why	the	diaper	is	going	on,	and	when	it	will	come	off.	You	should still	be	praising	or	at	least	acknowledging	what	your	child	is	learning.

You	may	find	that	occasionally,	upon	prompting	your	child	to	use	the	potty, you	will	be	met	with	a	clear,	firm	'No.'	This	is	different	than	resistance	(which looks	more	like	trying	to	put	a	cat	in	a	bucket	of	water).	What	I'm	talking	about here	 is	 a	 simple	 'No,'	 and	 when	 you	 hear	 this	 from	 your	 child,	 you	 need	 to respect	one	of	two	things:

- 1. She	may	not	have	to	go. By	the	end	of	these	first	few	days,	you	should	have	a	handle	on	her	patterns and	will	pretty	much	know	with	at	least	some	warning	when	she	has	to	pee.	I	say	this	because, again,	you	want	to	avoid	hounding	her.	You	want	to	have	at	least	a	rough	idea	that	she	may	have to	go,	so	you're	met	with	success.	When	a	child	says	clearly	that	they	don't	have	to	go,	respect that.	A	phrase	I	suggest	is,	'Okay,	I	trust	you	to	come	tell	me	when	you	do.	I'll	be	in	the	kitchen when	you	need	me.'	Period.	Notice	I	said	'when,'	not	'if,'	implying	that	this is going	to	happenit's	just	a	matter	of	time	(a	subtle	shift	in	language).	Don't	belabor	the	point,	just	tell	her	where you'll	be,	which	is	important	because	in	the	beginning	phases	of	training,	she	can't	hold	it	long enough	to	search	for	you	around	the	house.	Another	tactic	is	to	say,	'Well,	let's	try.	If	nothing comes	out,	we	can	try	again	later.'	Don't	abuse	this	by	trying	every	ten	minutes.	Every	half	hour	or so	should	yield	a	pee	at	some	point.
- 2. Your	child	is	really	involved	in	something	at	the	moment. When	you	want	your	child	to	do	something, say	it	clearly and	give	him	time	to	process	and	respond. Many	parents	say,	'Come	on,	it's	time	to	go.	I said	 come	 here.	 Now.	 Let's	 go.	 Did	 you	 hear	 me?	 Come	 on!'	 All	 this	 in	 a	 twenty-second	 time frame.	It	takes	the	average	toddler	thirty	seconds	to	hear,	process,	and	respond.	You	need	only	say it	 once	 (of	 course,	 after	 thirty	 seconds,	 your	 kid	 could	 just	 be	 digging	 his	 heels	 in	 and	 ignoring you).	We	usually	don't	like	it	when	our	toddlers	demand	we	drop	everything	that	second	to	attend to	them.	We	ask	them	to	hold	on	and	practice	patience.	Practice	what	you	preach.	Give	him	the opportunity	to	finish	up	what	he	is	doing.	Most	of	the	time,	he'll	come	in	short	order.

In	this	same	category	as	the	second	point	above	is	the	child	who	is	afraid	to miss	something	while	going	to	the	bathroom.	This	is	probably	the	number	one cause	of	accidents	both	in	the	early	stages	and	later.	Children	get	very	involved and	either	forget	to	think	about	whether	they	need	the	potty	or	don't	want	to miss	out.	There	are	a	couple	of	ways	to	deal	with	this.	You	can	have	the	activity come	 with	 you:	 'You	 can	 bring	 your	 truck	 with	 you	 to	 the	 bathroom.' Alternately,	you	can	directly	address	the	activity	(think	in	toddler-brain	here): 'Truck,	 you	 wait	 here.	 Pascal's	 going	 to	 pee	 and	 be	 right	 back.'	 Addressing inanimate	objects	is	a	great	tool	for	the	first	month	of	potty	training:	'Do	you want	to	show	your	bear	how	you	pee?	Let's	bring	him	to	watch.'	Kids	love	this. You	can	set	up	her	favorite	dolls	in	front	of	the	potty	to	'teach'	them	how	to	do it.	Be	creative	and	think	like	a	child.	If	you're	watching	a	video,	have	the	video 'wait'	by	pausing	it	(obviously,	much	harder	to	do	with	a	television	program).

So,	 yes,	 your	 child	 may	 pee	 and	 poop	 through	 several	 pairs	 of	 pants.	 For	 a limited	 time,	 this	 is	 okay.	 I	 have	 seen	 it	 happen	 a	 hundred	 times	 over. Generally,	the	child	is	still	processing	all	the	new	information.	Give	them	some time	to	figure	things	out.

I	will	make	no	bones	about	it.	Block	Two,	which	usually	comes	around	two to	six	days	from	your	start	date	is the	hardest	phase .	This	is	when	most	people	quit potty	training.	This	is	when	most	parents	panic.	Naked	(Block	One)	goes	well, and	clothes	muck	it	all	up.	Keep	going.	I	am	not	lying.	It	will	click.	As	they	say, 'When	going	through	hell	.	.	.	for	God's	sake,	keep	going	.	.	.'

If	you	find	yourself	losing	patience,	take	a	breather.	After	all,	you're	taking	a small	 amount	 of	 time	 to	 do	 what	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 country	 is	 taking	 a	 year	 or longer	to	do.

Block	Two	is	not	only	about	your	child	learning.	You	should	be	learning	as well.	Plan	not	only	to	learn	your	child's	signals	and/or	pee-pee	dance,	but	also	to learn	 his	 pee	 patterns.	 Some	 kids	 can	 drink	 4	 ounces	 of	 juice	 and	 pee	 seven times	in	the	next	hour.	Other	kids	can	drink	four	full	sippy	cups	and	hold	it	for six	hours.	Seriously.	The	whole	goal	here	is	to	find	a	rhythm	to	your	child's	day, and	figure	out	where	the	potty	fits	in.	If	you	have	a	frequent	pee-er,	you	may	not want	 to	 go	 anywhere	 for	 a	 while	 after	 that	 first	 glass	 of	 water.	 On	 the	 other hand,	 if	 you	 know	 you	 have	 a	 camel,	 go	 run	 a	 couple	 of	 errands.	 Of	 course, you're	not	going	to	know	your	child's	pee	habits	perfectly	after	only	a	few	days, but	it's	the	eventual	goal.

If	there	is	some	minor	resistance	during	Block	Two,	it's	most	likely	the	result of	pure	'toddlerness.'	There's	been	a	change	in	routine.	Remember	that	all	your child	has	ever	known	is	a	diaper.	Since	she	was	a	few	hours	old,	she	has	worn one.	She's	a	little	attached.	It's	okay.	This	is	just	something	to	keep	in	the	back of	your	mind.

When	facing	resistance,	most	parents	potty	training	on	their	own	give	up, often	 by	 deciding	 their	 child	 is	 not	 ready.	 Nothing	 could	 be	 further	 from	 the truth.	 If	 your	 child	 is	 capable	 of	 fighting	 for	 something	 she	 wants,	 she's	 more than	 ready	 for	 potty	 training.	 Resistance	 can	 result	 in	 a	 short	 period	 of unpleasantness,	but	then	it's	done	and	you're	over	the	hump.

## Block	Three

This	block	of	learning	should	be	about	solidifying	the	skills.	Don't	confuse	days with	blocks.	Block	Three	might	start	on	your	second	day	of	potty	training.	More likely,	though,	it's	going	to	start	somewhere	around	days	four	through	ten.	I'm only	mentioning	days	because	I	know	you	need	a	marker.	Seriously,	try	to	let the	 day	 thing	 go.	 Block	 Three	 brings	 more	 of	 the	 same-watching	 and prompting.	By	this	time,	you	can	have	any	combination	of	things	happening. You	 could	 have	 a	 clear	 sense	 of	 your	 child	 'getting	 it,'	 or	 you	 could	 still	 be lingering	somewhere	else	on	the	confidence	timeline.	It's	all	good.	A	few	days ago,	your	child	had	no	concept	of	where	pee	and	poop	went.	As	I	discussed	in Block	Two,	resistance	could	potentially	kick	up.	Alternately,	you	could	be	all set	 to	 take	 an	 eight-hour	 cross-country	 flight	 without	 diapers.	 The	 important thing	is	to	stay	calm	no	matter	where	you	find	yourself	in	the	process.

There's	no	better	way	to	help	your	child	hone	her	potty	skills	than	to	take her	 outside	 the	 norm.	 In	 this	 case,	 that	 means	 actually	 leaving	 the	 house	 for longer	 than	 a	 short	 walk	 around	 the	 block.	 For	 many	 of	 you,	 this	 is	 going	 to coincide	with	day	care.	Day	care,	like	poop,	can	be	one	of	the	most	frustrating aspects	of	potty	training.	So,	also	like	poop,	I	gave	it	its	own	glorious	chapter (see	chapter	12,	'Day	Cares	and	Other	Caregivers').

## Leaving	Home	for	Bigger	Chunks	of	Time

When	heading	out	for	a	longer	time,	be	sure	you	get	a	good	pee	before	leaving the	house.	I'm	not	suggesting	bugging	your	child	to	pee.	Rather,	wait	to	leave till	 you	 get	 that	 pee	 and	 then	 hit	 the	 road.	 Again,	 firm	 directives	 work	 best. 'You	need	to	pee	before	we	leave	the	house,	because	I	will	not	like	it	if	you	pee in	the	car.'	If	you're	pretty	sure	you	have	an	11:00	a.m.	pooper,	don't	leave	in that	time	frame	(remember	this	isn't	forever-you	are	still	starting	out).	Bring an	extra	outfit.	I	suggest	using	a	cloth	diaper	or	towel	to	line	the	car	seat.	Bring wipes.	 Hell,	 bring	 the	 potty	 chair!	 I'm	 a	 huge	 advocate	 of	 bringing	 the	 potty chair	or	insert	in	the	car.	It	doesn't	weigh	much	and	even	if	your	kid	poops,	you just	bring	it	home.	Not	much	different	than	carrying	around	a	poopy	diaper.	You want	to	plan	for	accidents.	They're	going	to	happen,	and	it's	okay.	But	chances are,	if	you	keep	your	small	outings	small,	you	may	not	have	any.

One	of	the	most	awesome	couples	I	ever	worked	with	took	on	potty	training like	a	Navy	SEAL	assignment.	They	had	a	total	tag	team	plan.	The	dad	took	the child	 out	 on	 trials	 runs	 all	 day	 on	 the	 second	 and	 third	 days.	 Seriously.	 They went	to	Target	and	the	market	and	the	library.	All	just	for	restroom	practice. And	you	know	what?	It	went	really	well.	I	just	loved	their	dedication	to	getting this	down,	no	matter	what	the	environment.	Something	to	consider.

Blocks	Two	and	Three	are	by	far	your	hardest	chunks	of	learning.	You,	the parent,	may	be	feeling	insane	or	incredibly	intense.	It's	normal,	but	try	to	chill out.	I	cannot	say	this	enough:	this	process	can	look	like	a	full-blown	disaster	and then	clear	up.	I	cannot	tell	you	the	amount	of	mail	I	get	in	which	a	mom	goes from	being	nearly	in	tears	to,	'Wow.	Never	mind,	he	just	sat	and	peed.'

Most	often,	somewhere	during	potty	training,	things	are	going	to	seem	off. The	 following	 two	 posts	 are	 extremely	 important.	 Be	 sure	 to	 read	 them	 again	 and again. I'm	convinced	this	is	where	most	parents	who	try	to	wing	it	totally	f**k	it up.	Pay	close	attention.	Seriously,	the	entire	crux	of	potty	training	is	in	these two	 posts.	 They	 address	 the	 areas	 where	 parents	 most	 commonly	 go	 wrong: rushing,	not	prompting,	and	overprompting.

Do	not	 overprompt	 or	 hover.	 Almost	 all	 resistance	 is	 because	 there	 is	 too much	'process'	in	the	process.	Certainly,	there	are	some	children	who	are	just really	difficult	to	potty	train.	However,	in	95	percent	of	the	people	I've	worked with,	resistance	is	the	result	of	hovering	parents.	Instead	of	blindly	promptingremember,	you	are	not	ASKING	if	he	has	to	go-look	for	signals.	Try	to	find	a pattern	and	a	rhythm.	If	you	need	to,	keep	a	mental	note	to	not	prompt	more than	 once	 per	 half-hour.	 Never,	 ever, evah should	 the	 prompting	 take	 on	 a begging,	cajoling,	negotiating	tone.	You	are	not	playing Let's	Make	a	Deal ;	you are	prompting	your	child	to	sit	and	pee.	Period.	This	can	be	done	firmly	without being	done	meanly.

## Prompting

A	very	common	complaint	I	hear	a	few	days	into	potty	training	is	something along	the	lines	of,	'He's	doing	fine	but	only	when	we	tell	him	to	go	.	.	.	is	this kid	EVER	going	to	tell	us	when	he	has	to	go??'

My	answer	is:	OF	COURSE	he	will!

But	right	now,	in	the	early	stages	of	potty	training,	your	child	needs	you.	It still	 counts	 if	 they	 pee	 in	 the	 potty	 because	 you	 tell	 them	 to.	 Like	 any	 other learning	 they	 have	 done	 or	 will	 do,	 they	 need	 you-the	 parent-as	 a	 crutch. Think	of	your	child	learning	to	walk.	They	had	to	hold	your	hands	at	first,	both for	the	physical	support	and	the	comfort.	Then	they	took	a	few	tentative	steps away	from	you	but	quickly	needed	your	hand	again.	In	strange	environments, they	 hold	 your	 hand	 to	 tug	 you	 along	 to	 where	 they	 want	 to	 investigate. Prompting	is	holding	their	hand.

Some	 kids might immediately	 start	 to	 self-initiate.	 Most	 kids	 will	 build	 it slowly;	 usually	 about	 three	 weeks	 into	 the	 process,	 you	 can	 start	 counting	 on self-initiating.	Until	then,	it	will	be	a	few	days	of	you	always	prompting.	Then there	will	be	a	few	days	during	which	they	tell	you	maybe	one	or	two	times	that they	have	to	go.	Then,	every	once	in	a	while,	they	will	sit	on	their	own	and	do their	business.	It	will	continue	to	build.	And	in	strange	situations,	you	may	have to	 do	 some	 more	hand	holding.	And	one	day	you	will	wake	up	and	not	have potty	training	on	the	brain.	I	swear	to	God,	this	day	will	come.

## When	to	Prompt

The	 big	 trick	 with	 prompting	 is	 to	 not	 overprompt.	 Ninety	 percent	 of	 all resistance	 is	 caused	 by	 overprompting.	 So	 the	 question	 becomes	 how	 often	 to prompt	without	slipping	into	overprompting	(aka	bugging,	nagging,	and	general overtalking	it).

While	your	child	is	learning	to	use	the	potty,	you	actually	should	be	learning some	 things,	 too:	 namely,	 your	 child's	 pee	 pattern.	 Some	 kids	 can	 drink	 4 ounces	of	fluid	and	pee	nine	times	in	an	hour.	Other	kids	are	camels	and	can drink	32	ounces	of	fluid	and	pee	twice	all	day.	Some	children	are	camels	until they	'break	the	seal'	(college	drinking	days,	anyone?).	Then	it's	nine	times	in an	hour.	Every	single	kid	is	different.	This	pee	pattern	is	going	to	let	you	get back	to	regularly	scheduled	life	after	potty	training.	If	you	know	you	have	a	big drinker	and	pee-er	in	the	morning,	don't	go	running	errands	first	thing.	If	you know	you	have	a	camel,	run	like	the	wind	to	get	your	shopping	done.

You	 will	 also	 be	 learning	 your	 child's	 particular	 pee-pee	 dance.	 Some	 kids have	the	classic	hopping	around,	ants-in-the-pants	dance.	Other	kids	are	crotch grabbers.	Some	kids	get	real	slow	and	silent.	The	first	few	days	of	potty	training should	get	you	acclimated	to	your	child's	particular	dance.	This	is	naturally	a good	time	to	prompt,	while	simultaneously	bringing	the	child's	awareness	to	the dance.	 Say	 something	 like,	 'I	 can	 see	 you	 have	 to	 pee.	 You	 are	 holding	 your penis.	Come,	sit	on	the	potty.'

Remember:	you	are	not	asking	your	child	if	he	has	to	pee.	You	are	prompting him	to	use	the	potty.

There	 are	 some	 other	 very	 natural,	 and	 therefore	 low-pressure,	 times	 to prompt.	 These	 are	 times	 we	 all	 go	 pee,	 so	 the	 prompts	 don't	 have	 a	 nagging quality	to	them	and	tend	not	to	interrupt	the	child	in	the	middle	of	something. These	are	called	easy	catches	in	'elimination	communication,'	or	EC	(thanks Andrea,	of	EC	Simplified),	and	they	occur:	upon	awakening	and	before	sleep, before	 leaving	 (anywhere)	 and	 upon	 arrival	 (anywhere),	 before	 and	 after prolonged	sitting	(high	chair,	car	seat,	laps,	and	couches),	and	before	and	after an	engaging	activity.

It's	also	okay	and	very	natural	to	hold	off	on	an	activity	until	your	child	pees, especially	 when	 you	 are	 very	 certain	 they	 need	 to.	 You	 might	 say	 something like,	 'Sure,	 we	 can	 leave	 for	 our	 walk	 as	 soon	 as	 you	 pee,'	 or,	 'Yes,	 you	 can watch	 Elmo.	 Sit	 and	 pee	 first.'	 This	 is	 not	 to	 be	 confused	 with	 bribery	 or rewarding,	which	would	look	something	like,	'I'll	let	you	watch	Elmo	if	you	sit and	 pee	 for	 Mommy.'	 Don't	 slip	 into	 bribery.	 You	 will	 end	 up	 with	 a	 power struggle.

It's	also	helpful	to	prompt	as	part	of	a	cluster	of	other	things.	'Please	pick	up your	 blocks.	 It's	 time	 for	 lunch.	 Go	 sit	 on	 the	 potty,	 then	 we'll	 wash	 hands.' This	does	two	things.	First,	it	puts	potty	training	in	the	normal	realm	of	'Things You	 Just	 Do.'	 Second,	 it	 keeps	 your	 tone	 and	 vibe	 normal.	 I	 know	 this	 is shocking,	 but	 parents	 can	 get	 shrill	 and	 anxious	 around	 potty	 training.	 A brilliant	 mom	 on	 our	 forum	 found	 that	 talking	 about	 using	 the	 potty	 as something	'helpful'	worked	wonders.	Her	daughter	loves	being	helpful	so	she would	phrase	it	as,	'Put	your	fork	on	the	table.	Put	your	cup	on	the	table.	Go	sit and	pee.	Thank	you.	You	are	such	a	big	help.'

The	delicate	dance	of	prompting	without	overprompting	is	an	important	one. It's	also	important	to	remember	that	this	is	temporary!	Many	parents	try	to	rush the	self-initiation	and	end	up	with	a	lot	of	accidents.	You	don't	want	to	do	this. If	your	child	doesn't	have	a	lot	of	success	to	build	on,	his	little	mind	will	go	to some	version	of,	'I	suck	at	this.	I'm	not	even	going	to	try	anymore.'	(I	call	it	the inner	 'f**k	 it.')	 You	 are	 building	 a	 tower	 of	 success.	 If	 you	 start	 kicking	 out blocks	from	the	foundation,	the	tower	will	tumble.

## Overprompting	and	Backing	Off

It	usually	goes	down	like	this:	around	the	fourth	or	fifth	day	into	potty	training, 'I	 don't	 know	 what	 happened!	 It	 was	 totally	 clicking.	 She	 HAD	 it.	 She	 was sitting	and	peeing	and	pooping.	Now,	all	of	a	sudden,	she	won't	sit	on	the	potty when	I	prompt	her	and	she's	having	accidents	all	over	the	place.	HELP!'

When	you	are	potty	training,	there	comes	a	time	when	you	actually	have	to hand	control	over	to	your	child.	Usually,	this	is	within	the	first	week.	A	really, really	good	sign	that	your	child	wants	you	out	of	her	business	is	when	she	'had it'	and	all	of	a	sudden	resists	or	starts	to	have	tons	of	accidents.

The	learning	phase	of	anything	sucks.	No	one	wants	to	'be	learning';	we	like to	'have	learned.'

This	is	a	catch-22,	and	it's	scary	as	hell.	You	need	to	give	control	over	to	her, and	she's	not	yet	proven	she	can	handle	it.	Failing	to	turn	over	control	at	the right	 time	 is	 a	 classic	 mistake	 in	 potty	 training-because	 your	 child	 isn't	 selfinitiating	and	going	on	her	own,	you	figure	you	have	to	keep	at	her.

In	reality,	what	you	need	to	do	is	give	her	room	to	make	the	right	choice	for herself.	 If	 you	 are	 constantly	 at	 her-watching,	 hovering,	 trying	 to	 help-she has	no	room	to	make	her	potty	use	her	own.	Now,	this	doesn't	mean	you	leave	it totally	up	to	her.	Prompting	is	going	to	be	necessary	for	a	bit	longer.	You	must prompt	without	overprompting,	which	sounds	awfully	Yoda-ish,	but	it's	true.

Here's	the	trick:	toss	the	prompts	out	there	with	as	little	energy	as	possible. Something	like,	'I	can	see	you	have	to	pee.	There's	your	potty.'	Then	drop	the matter.	Walk	away	and	let	it	go,	mentally	and/or	physically.	Now	she	can	make her	own	choice,	which	means	there's	nothing	to	resist.	If	you	don't	care,	there's nothing	for	her	to	fight.	I	mean,	of	course	you	care,	but	you	have	to	give	your child	the	room	to	learn	how	to	use	the	potty,	choose	to	do	so,	and	do	it	herself. The	lofty	reason	for	this:	it	makes	the	accomplishment	her	own.	The	reality:	it's easier	this	way.

Sometimes,	you	have	to	take	the	process	out	of	the	process.	Here's	a	direct quote	from	Alisha:

I	 definitely	 think	the	hands-off	approach	is	what	we	need	here.	I	think	experimenting	a	bit	really helped	us	to	figure	a	few	things	out.	First,	we	needed	to	take	the	potty	training	out	of	potty	training, if	that	makes	sense	at	all.	I	think	once	we	hit	a	snag	Friday,	we	all	got	too	focused	on	it,	and	everyone was	hyperaware	of	every	poop/pee/toot	that	came	out	of	her	and	we	weren't	just	being	a	family	and spending	time	together.	Tried	the	complete	opposite	today.	Didn't	really	talk	much	about	it	at	all except	when	I	needed	to,	and	kept	it	short	and	sweet.	I	guess	the	message	she	is	sending	me	is	that she	can	do	it	without	me	and	actually	does	better	that	way.	If	I	act	at	all	available	to	help	her,	she then	uses	me	like	a	crutch	and	suddenly	can't	do	anything	by	herself	anymore.

## 'Zactly.

At	the	end	of	Block	Three	you	should	have	some	confidence	in	being	able	to leave	 the	 house	 with	 clothes	 on	 (well,	 at	 least	 on	 your	 child).	 You	 can	 plan slightly	longer	outings,	maybe	to	a	friend's	house.	Be	mindful,	though,	that	you still	watch	your	child	for	signals.	It	should	already	be	getting	easier	to	see	those signals,	 but	 don't	 get	 engrossed	 in	 a	 conversation	 in	 another	 room.	 As	 I	 said, bring	the	potty	in	the	car.	I	remember	bringing	it	to	the	beach	with	Pascal.	He actually	got	out	of	the	water	to	use	his	potty!	I	was	impressed	that	he	didn't	just pee	in	the	water!	I	don't	think	it's	necessary	to	bring	the	potty	into	buildings that	do	have	toilets.	You	don't	want	to	foster	any	weird	attachment	to	just	that one	potty	(toddlers	 are	 notorious	 for	 weirdness).	 I	 would	 advise	 you	 keep	 the potty	in	the	back	of	the	car	when	you're	out.	You	can	pee	in	parking	lots,	pulled over	 on	 the	 freeway,	 or	 whenever	 you	 are	 out	 and	 about.	 I'll	 address	 public restrooms	later.

You	may	be	laughing-pulled	over	on	the	freeway?	This	is	a	very	important point.	If	your	child	indicates	that	he	has	to	go	pee,	you	drop	everything	and	go! I	 don't	 care	 where	 you	 are	 or	 what	 you're	 doing.	 GO!	 You must respect	 your child	in	this	regard.	She	can	not	wait	a	minute,	she	can	not	hold	on.	You've	got five	to	ten	seconds.	So	yes,	if	it	means	pulling	over	on	I-95,	that's	what	you	do. Think	about	it.	You've	spent	all	this	time	and	effort,	and	you're	finally	seeing the	payoff:	she's	asking	you.	To	risk	her	not	being	able	to	hold	it	and	having	an accident	 would	 be	 devastating	 to	 her,	 and	 I	 don't	 use	 the	 word devastating lightly.	Besides	avoiding	an	accident,	you're	showing	her	that	you	are	listening and	respecting	her	needs.	This	will	go	a	long	way	toward	her	doing	the	same. Don't	worry,	this	is	temporary.	Your	time	frame	for	getting	to	the	potty	will	keep increasing,	and	very	soon	your	child	will	be	able	to	hold	her	pee	and	poop	until you	can	get	to	a	regular	toilet.

Early	in	potty	training,	the	pre-pee	warning	progression	will	cap	off	at	around five	to	ten	seconds	(meaning	that	at	least	for	now,	when	your	child	signals	he has	to	pee,	you	have	five	to	ten	seconds	to	get	them	to	the	potty).	I	have	found that	they	can	wait	a	little	longer	if	you	at	least	respond.	Say	you're	doing	dishes in	the	kitchen	and	she's	in	the	playroom.	If	she	calls	out	that	she	needs	to	pee, you	would	say	as	you're	running	to	her,	'I'm	coming,	please	hold	it.'	You	will still	need	to	keep	an	eye	on	your	child	at	least	for	another	month	(although	not with	the	intensity	of	the	first	day).	Most	likely,	your	child	will	signal	with	her pee-pee	 dance,	 but	 if	 not,	 you've	 gotten	 her	 pee	 pattern	 down	 and	 know	 to prompt	her	at	certain	times.

Usually,	a	few	weeks	of	commando	and	bringing	along	the	potty	is	sufficient. After	a	month,	you	should	be	fine.	Of	course,	gauge	it	for	yourself.	If	you	think you	need	it	longer,	go	for	 it.	 Once	 again,	 think	 of	 how	 you	 can	 support	 your child	in	success.	You	want	to	line	up	everything	in	your	and	your	child's	favor!

## Blocks	Four,	Five,	and	Six	.	.	.	to	Infinity	and	Beyond!

By	now,	you	should	definitely	be	seeing	quantifiable	progress.	It	will	continue	to get	 easier	 and	 easier.	 Rather	 than	 keeping	 notes	 (for	 the	 love	 of	 God,	 please don't	keep	a	pee	log!)	strive	for	a	rhythm.	You	want	to	be	in	harmony	with	your child,	not	hounding	him	all	day	long.	The	parents	who	do	best	tend	to	be	very laid	 back	 and	 rely	 on	 their	 intuition.	 There's	 really	 no	 rule	 book	 here,	 just learning.

You	will	keep	building	on	success.	I	often	refer	to	this	as	'stacking	successes.' You	want	to	pay	close	attention	to	your	child's	successes	and	not	harp	on	the failures.	If	your	child	is	making	it	to	the	potty	more	often	than	not,	it's	good.	If she	 has	 five	 pees	 on	 the	 pot	 and	 two	 misses,	 that's	 good.	 Yes,	 it	 needs improvement,	but	it's	good.	It's	human	nature	to	pick	out	the	bad.	I	used	to	own a	children's	clothing	store.	Almost	all	of	my	customers	were	awesome,	but	still,	I would	go	home	bitching	about	the	one	customer	who	blew	my	day.	We	all	do this,	but	try	to	step	out	of	it	while	potty	training.	Yes,	we	want	to	fix	problems, but	we	don't	want	to	come	down	on	the	child	all	the	time.

These	 may	 very	 well	 be	 the	 weirdest,	 hardest	 few	 days	 of	 your	 parenting career. It can	 be	 tedious, doing	 this dance	 of balancing	 vigilance with casualness.	It	will	feel	like	it's	taking	a	lot	longer	than	it	is.	In	the	grand	scheme, you're	potty	training	in	a	short	period	of	time.	I	cringe	when	I	see	people	taking a	year	to	potty	train.	They	will	encounter	the	same	struggles	you	will,	only	theirs will	be	super	prolonged.

Should	 things	 seem	 like	 they're	 progressing,	 but	 at	 a	 slower	 rate	 than	 you anticipated,	that's	okay.	Continue	at	a	slower	rate.	If	there	appears	to	be	a	major snafu	 and	 you're	 seeing no progress,	 check	 out	 specific	 solutions	 in	 chapter	 7 ('Block	One	Drama')	and	chapter	8	('Block	Two	and	Three	Dilemmas').	Potty training	isn't	rocket	science,	but	it	isn't	a	single	simple	scenario,	either.	Every child	is	different,	and	I	think	I've	seen	every	possible	situation.	I	will	say	that almost	all	problems	can	be	solved	by	relieving	any	kind	of	pressure,	whether	it be	pressure	to	maintain	a	social	calendar,	to	prove	yourself,	to	do	this	right,	or	to potty	train	in	exactly	three	days	or	fewer.

Most	people	don't	have	any	trouble	at	all.	Most	likely,	your	child's	signals will	be	pretty	clear	to	both	of	you.	You	will	probably	feel	a	new	bond	with	this Big	Kid.	You	are	going	to	be	amazed	at	your	kid's	self-pride.	You	are	going	to	be blown	away	by	what	she	is	capable	of.	Seriously	.	.	.	this	is	going	to	rock	your world.	One	of	the	absolute	coolest	things	I've	found	about	potty	training	is	it gives	 you	 a	 look	 into	 your	 child's	 psyche.	 You	 gain	 insight	 into	 your	 child's learning	methods	and	curve,	and	that's	wonderful!

Not	 every	 kid	 learns	 the	 same	 way.	 Good	 teachers	 know	 this.	 When	 a student	isn't	learning,	they	find	a	back	door	to	teaching,	and	they	get	creative. So	many	parents	give	potty	training	a	whirl-a	half-assed	whirl,	usually-and are	quick	to	throw	a	diaper	back	on	because	they	'aren't	getting	it.'	Man.	There would	 be	 like	 three	 kids	 left	 in	 school	 if	 teachers	 threw	 in	 the	 towel	 when students	'didn't	get	it.'	When	your	child	isn't	learning	something,	you	amp	up the	teaching,	no?	You	don't	ditch	it.

We	have	no	way	to	know	how	your	child	will	learn	this	until	you	jump	in. It's	important	to	remember	that	this	is	probably	the	first	thing	you	are	actively teaching	and	the	first	thing	he	is	actively	learning.	That	is	to	say,	this	is	the	first case	in	which	you're	teaching	and	he's	learning	something	that	must	take	place in	a	certain	order	and	for	which	there	really	is	only	one	'right'	outcome.	The more	 you	 can	 look	 at	 potty	 training	 as	 just	 something	 you	 are	 teaching	 your child,	the	better	off	you	are	going	to	be.

Underpants,	self-initiation,	and	night/nap	dryness	all	sort	of	blend	into	the recipe	at	around	three	weeks	after	your	start	date.	Use	your	parental	intuition and	 judgment;	 I	 know	 you	 have	 it!	 Push	 the	 limits	 a	 little.	 Don't	 be	 fearful. Remember,	above	all,	your	vibe	and	energy	are	running	the	show.

To	 recap,	 progressing	 through	 the	 blocks	 of	 learning	 is	 what's	 important. Don't	 track	 this	 by	 days.	 Make	 sure	 to	 meet	 the	 goals	 of	 each	 block	 before moving	 on.	 The	 transition	 points	 from	 prepotty	 training	 to	 Block	 One,	 and from	Block	One	to	Block	Two,	are	where	most	parents	panic.	It's	okay.	Move through	those	transitions.	You	are	looking	for	progress,	not	perfection.	You	are looking	 for	 forward	 movement.	 If	 your	 child	 races	 to	 the	 potty	 but	 has	 an accident	 on	 the	 way,	 that's	 awesome;	 he	 was	 moving	 in	 the	 right	 direction. Evaluate	success	through	the	lens	of	a	teacher	who	is	looking	for	progress.

And	have	wine	handy.	Or	really	good	chocolate.

CHAPTER	6

## Nighttime	Training

B efore	we	launch	into	nighttime	training,	let	me	state	something	very	clearly:	I have	separated	out	nighttime	from	daytime	because	to	potty	train	for	both	at once	looks	very	overwhelming	to	most	parents,	particularly	those	who	work	full time	out	of	the	home. But	potty	training	for	night	and	day	at	the	same	time	is	the most	effective	way	to	potty	train. It	will	be	more	chaotic	for	a	few	days,	but	in	the long	 run	 you	 will	 have	 almost	 zero	 hassles	 down	 the	 road.	 When	 there	 is	 no backup-no	other	option-there	are	no	power	struggles	(what's	there	to	fight for?),	 there's	 less	 confusion	 and	 less	 withholding	 of	 pee	 and	 poop.	 When	 you make	using	the	potty	the	new	way	of	doing	things	day	AND	night,	it	becomes second	nature	much	faster.	It's	totally	up	to	you,	and	I	won't	judge	either	way, but	I	just	have	to	throw	it	out	there	that	tackling	day	and	night	at	the	same	time is	the	better	way	to	train.	To	do	both	at	the	same	time,	you	would	simply	follow the	daytime	instructions	as	I	described	them	in	the	previous	chapter,	adding	in the	nighttime	instructions	addressed	here.	Give	this	some	serious	thought	before you	make	a	decision	one	way	or	another.

The	biggest	thing	to	remember	about	nighttime	is	that	it's	a	long-ass	time. That's	 the	 major	 difference	 between	 naps	 and	 night.	 Toddlers	 should	 be sleeping	anywhere	from	nine	to	thirteen	hours	each	night;	that's	a	long	time	to go	without	peeing!	Think	about	it;	most	adults	wake	up	to	pee	at	least	once	a night	and	we're skilled at	using	the	potty.

I've	 searched	and	searched	for	the	Magic	Nighttime	Trick;	it	doesn't	exist. There's	no	way	around	it.	To	train	for	nighttime,	you	have	to:

- 1.	carefully	monitor	fluid	intake	before	bedtime	and/or
- 2.	wake	your	child	to	pee.

Sorry.	I	wish	there	were	a	magic	trick	I	could	give	you.	I	do,	however,	have some	tips	to	make	night	training	a	lot	easier	on	you.

You	 will	 want	 to	 monitor	 fluids	 about	 two	 to	 three	 hours	 before	 bedtime, making	sure	there's	minimal	intake.	This	can	be	hard	on	your	child	if	you	do	it suddenly.	If	your	kid	is	used	to	lots	of	fluid	before	bed,	I	would	start	by	scaling back	gradually	before	you	attempt	your	first	diaperless	night.	Avoid	sippy	cups and	bottles	at	night	(really,	these	shouldn't	be	used	at	nighttime	now	anyway). The	sucking	action	leads	kids	to	take	in	more	than	they	would	if	they	were	using a	cup.	A	great	trick	I've	learned	is	to	buy	tiny	cups:	sake	cups,	mini	teacups,	or even	shot	glasses.	This	gives	the	illusion	of	a	full	glass,	even	though	there's	very little	liquid	in	it.	Also,	kids	love	little	things	that	are	their	size.	I	know	quite	a few	 moms	 who've	 developed	 a	 lovely	 nighttime	 tea	 ritual	 with	 their	 kids (chamomile	tea	is	widely	accepted	as	promoting	sleep	and	calm).	Little	cups	also come	in	handy	for	the	classic	bedtime	stall,	'I	need	a	drink	of	water.'	If	your	kid pulls	 this,	 you	 can	 use	 a	 tiny	 cup	 to	 give	 him	 a	 drink	 without	 worrying	 he's taking	in	too	much	fluid.

How	do	you	plan	for	a	reduction	in	fluids	before	bed?	Think	of	the	day	in terms	of	two	upside-down	pyramids.	One	pyramid	spans	the	time	from	waking	to nap,	 the	 other	 spans	 the	 time	 from	 nap	 waking	 to	 sleep.	 The	 width	 of	 the pyramid	represents	the	amount	of	fluid	your	child	should	be	drinking;	go	heavy on	 fluids	 upon	 awakening,	 and	 then	 taper	 to	 almost	 nothing	 about	 an	 hour before	nap	and	at	least	two	hours	before	bedtime.	If	your	child	is	used	to	having a	 big	 glass	 of	 something	 with	 dinner,	 this	 habit	 needs	 to	 change.	 Making	 the change	can	be	tricky	for	a	day	or	so,	but	your	child	will	get	used	to	it.	You'll then	need	to	withhold	fluids	from	dinner	on.	Withholding	fluids	before	sleep will	naturally	make	your	child	thirstier	in	the	morning,	which	works	perfectly with	the	fluid	pyramid.	Most	kids	have	drinking	patterns	that	resemble	rightside-up	pyramids.	The	child	is	used	to	a	decent-sized	drink	before	bed.	If	your kid	 falls	 into	 this	 category,	 start	 the	 fluid-tapering	 song	 and	 dance	 before	 you actually	intend	to	begin	night	training.	After	all,	you	know	toddlers	and	change -not	good.

If	 you	 are	 still	 nursing	 intermittently	 throughout	 the	 night,	 night	 training could	be	a	little	trickier.	Generally	speaking,	however,	most	kids	at	this	age	are nursing	 for	 comfort	 rather	 than	 volume,	 so	 they	 may	 not	 be	 taking	 in	 much fluid. Also,	 you	 could	 have	 your	 child	 pee	 before	 or	 after	 nursing.	 Pick whichever	option	best	fits	your	child.	Some	kids	like	to	pee	before	nursing,	most prefer	it	afterward.	Either	is	fine,	but	the	trick	is	consistency.

If	 you	 are	 cosleeping,	 the	 good	 news	 is	 that	 night	 training	 is	 much	 easier. Your	child	has	no	travel	time,	and	usually	gets	restless	right	before	needing	to pee,	which	will	help	alert	you	to	the	situation.	It's	also	a	lot	easier	on	you	if	all you	need	to	do	is	roll	over	as	opposed	to	walking	down	the	hall	to	your	child's room.	 That	 said,	 though,	 if	 you	 haven't	 ever	 had	 the	 desire	 to	 cosleep,	 I wouldn't	recommend	starting	just	to	make	night	training	easier.

As	for	waking	up	your	child	to	pee,	I	recommend	starting	with	two	wakings, so	you	can	establish	in	your	own	mind	when	during	the	night	your	child	does her	peeing.	Does	she	pee	at	10:00	p.m.	and	2:00	a.m.?	At	12:00	a.m.	and	4:00 a.m.?	Some	kids	pee	an	hour	after	going	down,	some	kids	pee	once	at	3:00	a.m. If	you	do	two	wakings	for	a	week	or	so-I	recommend	10:00	p.m.	and	2:00	a.m. wakings	at	first,	though	you	can	adjust	as	needed-you	should	begin	to	develop a	good	idea	of	when	your	child	is	peeing.	Unfortunately,	unless	you	want	to	stay up	all	night,	there's	a	bit	of	guesswork	here,	which	is	why	if	you	find	your	child isn't	peeing	at	10:00	p.m.	or	2:00	a.m.,	you	may	want	to	adjust	the	waking	times. Even	if	your	child's	diapers	have	been	dry	upon	waking	in	the	morning	lately, you	might	want	to	try	at	least	one	waking	for	a	short	time	at	the	beginning	of night	training.	The	idea	behind	this	is	not	just	to	catch	the	pee,	but	also	to	train your	child's	body	to	wake	up	if	he	needs	to	go.	Unfortunately,	the	idea	of	waking to	pee	isn't	something	you	can	explain	to	the	child	in	words.	It	has	to	be	learned physically,	through	waking.	(Sorry!)

Here's	the	easiest,	least	disruptive	way	to	go	about	handling	these	wakings. Set	your	cell	phone	alarm	so	you	don't	have	the	blaring	alarm	clock	going	off	in the	middle	of	the	night.	Have	the	potty	chair	right	next	to	the	child's	bed.	It's best	if	she	wears	two-piece	pajamas	for	the	sake	of	simplicity,	especially	in	the winter.	 Don't	 wake	 your	 child	 too	 soon	 after	 she's	 gone	 to	 sleep,	 or	 too	 soon before	you	expect	her	to	wake	up	for	morning.	This	would	result	in	her	waking fully,	 which	 is	 something	 nobody	 wants!	 Unless	 your	 child	 wakes	 fully	 at	 the drop	of	a	pin,	I	wouldn't	worry	about	her	waking	for	good	if	you	rouse	her	to	pee in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 night.	 She's	 likely	 to	 stay	 at	 least	 partially	 asleep.	 The harder	part	is	holding	up	her	limp	weight.	Mostly-asleep	kids	are	kind	of	like	wet spaghetti.	 Heavy,	 wet	 spaghetti.	 Get	 her	 to	 the	 potty,	 and	 then	 you	 can	 just hold	her	up	and	whisper	for	her	to	pee.	I've	always	found	it	helpful	to	make	a sshhhing	 noise	 (similar	 to	 the	 sound	 of	 peeing)	 in	 the	 child's	 ear.	 Even	 half asleep,	your	child	may	indicate	she	doesn't	have	to	pee.	Just	pull	up	her	pajamas and	put	her	back	down.	A	really	good	trick	is	to	use	a	big	plastic	party	cup	(or any	similarly	sized	reusable	container).	You	can	just	stand	your	child	up-this works	for	 both	 girls	 and	 boys-and	 have	 her	 pee	 in	 it.	 Mostly-asleep	 kids	 are easier	to	hold	this	way,	since	they're	taking	some	of	their	own	weight,	and	the whole	thing	goes	quickly	and	smoothly.

It	 seems	 obvious	 to	 me,	 but	 I'll	 say	 it	 anyway:	 you	 don't	 want	 to	 turn	 on bright	 lights	 and	 try	 to	 lug	 your	 child	 to	 the	 bathroom	 (hence	 the	 suggestion that	you	keep	the	potty	near	your	child's	bed).	If	you	do,	you'll	have	yourself	a wide-awake	toddler	party	at	2:00	a.m.	Not	desirable.

Once	 you	 figure	 out	 approximately	 when	 your	 child	 is	 typically	 peeing	 at night,	you	can	cut	down	to	just	one	waking.	I	have	found	that	it	helps	a	lot	to tell	your	child-right	before	he	goes	to	sleep-to	hold	his	pee	until	you	come for	 him.	 It's	 his	 last	 conscious	 thought	 this	 way,	 and	 works	 its	 way	 into	 his subconscious.	You	can	then	start	scooching	the	time	of	the	pee	waking	a	little bit	each	night,	till	it's	about	two	hours	before	his	normal	morning	wake-up	time. If	he	can	make	it	to	two	hours	before	his	normal	wake	up,	that's	a	good	sign	that he	can	hold	it	all	night.

Eventually,	your	child	will	either	be	able	to	hold	it	all	night	or	will	wake	up to	ask	to	pee.	You'll	know	she's	ready	to	go	all	night	when	she	routinely	says	no or	shakes	her	head	during	the	wake-up	pee.	Even	if	it	starts	to	look	like	she's able	to	hold	it	all	night,	continue	to	monitor	fluids	in	the	evening.	If	she	shows the	 ability	 to	 wake	 up	 (by	 herself)	 to	 pee,	 you	 don't	 have	 to	 be	 so	 vigilant. Either	scenario	is	equally	acceptable.

Nighttime	 potty	 training	 can	 take	 longer	 than	 daytime	 potty	 training,	 but won't	necessarily.	Each	child	is	different	and	each	parent's	level	of	commitment is	different.	Be	gentle	with	yourself	and	realistic	with	your	capabilities.	As	with day	training,	repetition	and	consistency	are	the	most	important	factors.	If	you absolutely	know	you	are	unable	to	wake	up	to	assist	your	child,	then	you	may need	to	be	an	ultravigilant	fluid	monitor	before	bed.	The	reverse	is	also	true:	if you	simply	cannot	monitor	fluids	before	bed,	commit	to	waking	up.	You	do	need to	deal	with	night	training	at	some	point.

## Is	Night	Training	Necessary?

Yes.	Or	maybe	no.	How's	that	for	a	solid	answer?

Many,	many	children	will	start	staying	dry	on	their	own	as	they	get	better and	better	at	holding	and	consolidating	during	the	day.	A	really	good	indicator that	a	child	is	ready	for	night	training	is	when	they	start	staying	dry	for	their nap. However,	this	isn't	true	for	every	kid. So,	don't	wait	for	that	necessarily,	but should	your	child	start	staying	dry	during	naps,	go	for	it!

On	that	note,	there	is	no	such	thing	as just nap	training.	You	can	always	try to	go	with	a	diaper	for	nap,	but	there	is nothing we	can	do	to	assist	the	child	(i.e., you	can't	wake	a	child	midnap	to	help	them	empty	their	bladder).

It's	always	best	to	ditch	all	diapers	as	soon	as	you	are	able.	But	night	training can	 be	 wonky	 because	 there really is	 an	 issue	 of	 whether	 or	 not	 the	 child's bladder	is	able	to	hold	and	consolidate	for	such	a	long	time.

My	bottom	line	is	that	night	training	can	be	on	the	back	burner	until	around three	to	three	and	a	half.	If	it	hasn't	naturally	occurred	by	then, you	must	attend to	it .	The	bladder	is	being	developed	at	this	age,	and	if	it	develops	fully	without the	practice	of	holding	and	consolidating,	those	muscles	will	atrophy,	and	you will	struggle	indefinitely	with	bedwetting.

I	can	in	no	way	know	for	certain	what	is	true	for	every	single	child	out	there. I	just	can't.	But	I	can	see	trends	in	the	thousands	of	kids	I	have	worked	with.	A very	real	and	serious	trend	I	see	is	that	once	a	child	is	past	the	age	of	four,	night training	becomes	near	impossible.

I	 regularly	 get	 clients,	 including	 pediatricians,	 with	 five-,	 six-,	 and	 sevenyear-olds	 in	 nighttime	 diapers	 (pull-ups,	 which	 are	 diapers).	 They	 think	 they don't	have	to	attend	to	night	training,	and	time	just	keeps	marching	on.	And then	the	child's	muscles	are	atrophied,	and	night	training	is	incredibly	hard.

Now	granted,	there	are	some	truly	tough	and	rare	cases.	But	the	sheer	volume of	kids	currently	over	four	in	night	diapers	is	not	right.	It's	not	an	issue	of	the kids	not	being	able	to	do	it.	It's	an	issue	of	the	wicking	of	disposables,	the	child not	 feeling	 the	 wetness,	 and	 the	 aggressive	 marketing	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the	 big diaper	companies.

So,	no.	You	don't	have	to	dive	into	night	training	if	you	don't	feel	up	to	it yourself.	Or	if	your	child	has	been	struggling	with	sleep.	Or	if	you're	struggling with	 sleep.	 But	 I	 can't	 say	 it	 enough: Do	 not	 go	 past	 three	 and	 a	 half	 without attending	to	it.

Completely	random	side	note	to	end	this	chapter.	If	you	are	over	thirty-two weeks'	pregnant	with	another	child,	it's	so	totally	cool	to	put	off	night	training until	the	baby	is	around	four	to	six	weeks.	You	need	to	rest,	save	energy	for	labor and	birth,	and	adjust	to	life	with	a	newborn.	You	can	attend	to	night	training when	you	are	waking	for	night	feedings	for	the	baby.	There	is	no	reason	to	stress yourself	out	with	night	training	right	now.	Unless,	of	course,	you	want	to.	Then go	for	it,	Mama.

## Nighttime	Accidents

Nighttime	 accidents	 are	 inevitable.	 Some	 nights	 your	 child	 might	 drink	 too much	 fluid,	 and	 others,	 you	 might	 simply	 forget	 to	 wake	 (or	 sleep	 through waking)	your	child.	As	these	accidents	are	inevitable,	I've	found	a	pretty	good way	to	deal	with	them:	while	your	child	is	going	through	the	transition	from diapers	to	diaperless	at	night,	keep	an	extra	pair	of	pajamas	and	a	thick	fleece blanket	near	the	bed.	Should	your	child	have	an	accident,	change	her	pajamas and	be	sure	to	ask	or	sit	her	on	the	potty	in	case	she	has	more	pee-often	she won't	have	emptied	her	bladder	completely.	Instead	of	changing	sheets	in	the middle	 of	 the	 night,	 simply	 place	 the	 fleece	 blanket	 over	 the	 wet	 sheet.	 The fleece	will	keep	the	pee	from	soaking	her	dry	pajamas.	This	may	sound	gross	to some,	 but	 it	 sure	 beats	 having	 to	 change	 the	 sheets	 when	 you're	 both	 halfawake.	Of	course,	change	the	sheets	in	the	morning.	One	more	thing:	nighttime accidents	are	all	on	you.	The	capability	to	hold	the	pee	until	morning	or	to	be able	to	wake	herself	up	to	pee	develops	over	time,	and	if	your	child	can't	do	it yet,	she	can't	do	it	yet-you	have	to	wake	her	to	pee	until	her	body	is	ready	to consolidate	and	hold	through	the	night.

If	your	child	is	consistently	(as	in,	every	night)	having	nighttime	accidents, adjust	something.	You	don't	have	to	abandon	night	training.	You	may,	however, need	to	change	the	times	you	wake	him	or	monitor	his	fluids	even	more	closely. Be	creative	and	do	what	works	for	you	and	your	family.

If	 night	training	looks	like	a	full-blown	disaster	after	a	week	of	attempts-I mean,	you	are	barely	sleeping	and	are	still	missing	the	pees-your	child	might be	an	extremely	deep	sleeper. Caveat :	 this	 is	 not	 common.	If	you	suspect	your child	is	a	really	deep	sleeper,	you	might	look	into	one	of	the	few	different	alarm products	on	the	market.	These	alarms	wake	your	child	just	as	she	is	beginning	to pee.	Personally,	I	have	never	used	any	of	these,	but	I've	heard	excellent	reports from	the	parents	who	have.

CHAPTER	7

## Block	One	Drama

I n	this	chapter,	I	will	address	the	common	problems	in	the	first	week	of	potty training.	 If	 you	 are	 having	 difficulties,	 read	 through	 all	 the	 drama	 chapters. Problems	can	crop	up	at	any	point	in	potty	training,	not	just	during	Block	One. Separating	 problems	 by	 block	 is	 just	 my	 attempt	 to	 keep	 an	 overwhelming amount	of	information	semiorganized.

Okay.	So	you	are	making	your	way	through	Block	One	of	potty	training.	I'm sure	 you	 are	 exhausted.	 It's	 very	 odd	 how	 exhausting	 watching	 your	 child	 is, huh?

You	are	most	likely	reading	this	chapter	because	you	are	unsure	of	how	things are	 going.	 Or	 you	 know	 for	 a	 fact	 things	 are	 not	 going	 well.	 You	 may	 have	 a great	feeling,	or	you	may	be	devastated.	Or	confused.	Or	unsure.	Yes,	you	will run	the	gamut	of	emotions	for	the	next	week,	I'm	sure.	Regardless	of	how	you're feeling	about	potty	training,	do	not	let	a	successful	(or	failed)	poop	or	pee	in	the potty	determine	your	emotional	state.	In	fact,	it's	a	good	idea	never	to	let	your toddler's	behavior	dictate	your	emotional	state,	though	I	know	that's	easier	said than	done.	Remember,	though,	potty	training	progress	is	not	a	measurement	of your	parenting	abilities	nor	of	how	smart	your	child	is.

Having	 said	 that,	 let's	 go	 through	 and	 see	 where	 you're	 at	 and	 what,	 if anything,	you	need	to	do	differently.	Remember	the	time	line	of	potty	training: Clueless	 to	 I	 Peed	 to	 I'm	 Peeing	 to	 I	 Have	 to	 Go	 Pee.	 We	 are	 looking	 for progress,	 not	 perfection!	 I'm	 going	 to	 refer	 alternately	 to	 'blocks'	 and	 'days,' because	no	matter	how	much	I	want	you	to	avoid	tracking	progress	by	days,	you are	going	to.

There	 are	 really,	 honestly,	 truly	 no	 disasters	 in	 the	 first	 couple	 of	 days	 of potty	training.	There	can't	be;	it's	too	new.	You	are	changing	a	routine,	a	habit that	 has	 been	 in	 place	 for	 somewhere	 around	 two	 years.	 That's	 not	 going	 to happen	in	a	day.

No	poop: The	most	common	cause	for	a	parental	freak-out	is	not	getting	a	poop on	 the	 first	 day.	 You	 may	 have	 noticed	 that	 poop	 has	 its	 very	 own	 chapter. Yeah.	It's	that	big	a	freaking	deal.	Do	not	worry	if	there's	no	poop	on	the	first day.	 Your	 child	 was	 most	 likely	 a	 once-,	 twice-,	 or	 three-times-a-day	 pooper when	she	was	diapered.	Almost	every	child	I've	ever	worked	with	goes	down	to one	 poop	 a	 day	 during	 potty	 training.	 I	 think	 this	 consolidation	 of	 poops	 is natural.	 Most	 adults	 only	 poop	 once	 a	 day,	 if	 that.	 There's	 nothing	 to	 worry about	from	a	medical	standpoint	if	your	kid	has	a	day	or	two	of	no	pooping.	For many	kids,	that	 first	 day	 of	 potty	 training	 is	 very	 strange-all	 this	 focus	 on	 a previously	unnoticed	thing-and	there's	bound	to	be	some	performance	anxiety.

If	 there's	 no	 poop,	 don't	 sweat	 it.	 Carry	 on	 like	 normal.	 Be	 aware,	 though, that	a	poop	is	most	certainly	coming	at	some	point.	Go	look	over	chapter	10, 'Poop'	and	see	if	anything	there	pops	out	at	you.	But	honestly,	especially	on	the first	day,	this	is	normal.

A	crazy	amount	of	pee: If	your	child	seemed	to	spend	the	whole	day	peeing	and not	noticing,	you	most	likely	overdid	the	fluid	consumption.	Just	go	back	to	a normal	 amount	 of	 liquid.	 Remember,	 kids	 under	 twenty-four	 months	 in particular	can't	seem	to	handle	excessive	fluid	intake.	On	the	flip	side,	do	make sure	 you're	 monitoring	 fluid	 intake	 to	 some	 degree.	 This	 doesn't	 mean	 you should	restrict	liquids;	it	just	means	keep	an	eye	out	for	when	and	how	much your	 child	 drinks	 relative	 to	 when	 and	 how	 much	 he	 pees	 so	 you	 can	 get	 a handle	on	his	normal	patterns.

Hardly	any	pee	at	all: So,	 you	 gave	 your	 child	 five	 extra	 juices	 boxes,	 which would	normally	yield	eight	diaper	changes.	With	the	diapers	off,	however,	your child	has	suddenly	become	a	camel.	If	you	only	got	a	few	pees	on	day	one,	it's okay.	 Some	 children	 can	 really	 hold	 it.	 You	 don't	 have	 to	 assume	 she	 is purposely	 withholding	 the	 pee,	 just	 that	 she	 can	 control	 her	 bladder.	 That's awesome.	A	child	who	can	hold	it	is	preferable	to	one	who	has	to	go	every	time there's	even	a	small	amount	of	pee	in	her	bladder.	Don't	necessarily	increase	the fluid	intake,	but	rather	try	to	get	a	handle	on	her	pee	patterns.	Start	to	get	a	feel for	 how	long	she	can	hold	it	after	taking	in	fluid	so	you	can	predict	the	most appropriate	times	to	prompt.	My	best	friend's	husband	pees	once	a	day-I	kid you	not.	Also,	the	dude	has	never	had	a	urinary	tract	infection.	Some	people	are just	 camels.	 However,	 beware	 the	 camel	 .	 .	 .	 once	 the	 'seal'	 is	 broken,	 so	 to speak,	many	camels	pee	several	times	in	a	short	period.

Absolutely	no	awareness	of	having	peed: Okay,	you're	chill	with	the	notion	of progress	rather	than	perfection,	you're	relaxed	that	your	kid	isn't	going	to	figure this	all	out	in	a	day,	you	are	not	freaking	out	.	.	.	but	geez,	Louise,	this	kid	is showing no recognition	that	he	just	peed.	WTH?	This	happens	most	often	in children	 under	 twenty-two	 months.	 Regardless	 of	 your	 child's	 age,	 however, you'll	want	to	make	sure	she	truly	is	'clueless,'	rather	than	simply	ignoring	the pee.	'Clueless'	means	.	.	.	clueless.	How's	that	for	a	rock-solid	definition?	The child	who	pees	and	pretends	it	didn't	happen	is not clueless.	See	the	difference? The	truly	clueless	will	pee	while	walking,	slip	on	it,	fall,	and	have	no	idea	what the	 hell	 just	 happened.	 If,	 by	 the	 end	 of	 day	 one,	 your	 child	 is	 still	 totally clueless,	it's	okay.	All	it	means	is	that	you	are	still	in	Block	One.	If	your	child pees	and	pretends	it	doesn't	happen,	however	.	.	.

Kid	 pees	 and	 pretends	 it	 doesn't	 happen: For	 this	 kid,	 remind	 him	 that	 pee goes	in	the	potty.	Frown	or	make	an	otherwise	displeased	facial	expression	and say,	'No	pee	on	the	floor.	Pee	goes	in	the	potty.'	Make	those	statements	in	that specific	order,	putting	the desired	result last.	Kids	tend	to	remember	the	last	thing you	 said	 a	 little	 better;	 it	 just	 seems	 to	 stick.	 You	 don't	 want	 to	 be	 mean	 or reprimanding,	but	you	do	need	to	express	that	peeing	on	the	floor	is	NOT	good and	peeing	in	the	potty	IS	good.

As	for	handling	the	accident,	don't	panic.	You	want	to	have	him	help	you clean	up	and	sit	on	the	potty	to	finish	eliminating	any	pee	he	may	have	left.	You can	say	something	to	the	effect	of,	'I	know	you	are	learning, and your	pee	goes in	the	potty.' Do	not say,	'It's	okay.'	I'll	repeat	this	a	lot.	This	phrase	seems	to imply	 permission	 (to	 pee	 on	 the	 floor)	 to	 some	 kids,	 even	 if	 what	 you	 really mean	to	express	is,	'My	head	is	not	going	to	explode	or	anything.'	Essentially, acknowledge	that	he's	still	learning	while	consistently	reinforcing	the	idea	that pee	goes	in	the	potty.

The	two	seconds	 you	 turned	 your	 back	 .	 .	 . You've	 hardly	 been	 breathing, watching	like	a	hawk	for	her	pee-pee	dance,	a	sign,	a	twitch,	a	signal.	Nada.	So you	have	to	pee	or	get	more	coffee	(or	beer)	and	the two	freaking	seconds your back	 is	 turned,	 she	 pees	 right	 there	 on	 the	 floor.	 Argh.	 How	 is	 this	 possible? Well,	there's	good	news:	this	kid	is	well	on	her	way	to	being	potty	trained.	If	she can	hold	it	 until	 the	 two	 seconds	 you	 turn	 your	 back,	 yep,	 that	 kid	 is	 almost done	potty	training.	Think	about	it.	Most	likely,	this	is	her	way	of	asking	for privacy.	Remember,	even	though	we	don't	think	of	it	this	way,	a	diaper	conceals bodily	 functions,	 so	 it	 provides	 some	 privacy,	 right?	 Even	 though	 we	 see	 and clean	 up	 the	 messy	 diaper	 afterward,	 she	 still	 had	 privacy	 during	 the	 act	 of eliminating.	Now	her	bum's	in	the	breeze	and	there's	no	privacy.	It's	very	cool to	want	privacy.	It's	the	natural	progression	of	potty	training.	So	give	her	some. When	 you	 think	 it's	 about	 time	 for	 her	 to	 go,	 set	 her	 up	 on	 the	 potty	 and conveniently	'forget'	something	in	the	other	room.	If	she's	using	an	insert	on the	big	potty,	it's	the	same	deal,	and	you	can	close	the	bathroom	door	partially. Nine	times	out	of	ten,	she'll	pee	the	second	you	leave	the	room.	This	goes	for poop,	too.

Also,	 whenever	 you	 have	 to	 pee	 during	 the	 beginning	 phases	 of	 potty training,	 bring	 your	 child	 with	 you.	 This	 is	 a	 great	 thing	 to	 do	 together.	 It normalizes	and	models	the	behavior.	It's	an	all-around	win.

The	kid	who	does	absolutely	no	signaling	whatsoevah: Okay.	 Again,	 you're watching	like	a	hawk	and	for	the	life	of	you,	you cannot	see any	sort	of	signal. Now,	I	don't	want	to	seem	contrary,	but	every	single	child	has	a	signal.	I'm	not saying	you	weren't	watching	for	it;	I	know	you	were.	It's	just	that	for	some	kids, the	signal	is	really	subtle.	A	former	client	was	convinced	her	daughter,	Jessie, had	no	signal.	On	the	second	day	of	potty	training-Jessie	was	still	naked	at	this point-she	finally	saw	it:	Jessie	crossed	her	big	toe	over	the	middle	toe	when	she needed	to	pee. Weird ,	 right?	 Subtle,	 and	 small,	 and	 not	 in	 the	 general	 'potty area'	of	the	body.	This	is	part	of	the	reason	I	insist	on	at	least	one	naked	day. Every	kid	has	some	sort	of	pause	or	signal	right	before	they	pee.	I'm	not	saying it's	going	to	be	big	or	obvious,	but	if	you	look	closely,	you'll	see	something.	The pre-pee	signal	could	be	a	pause	in	speech,	a	look	he	gets	in	his	eye,	a	twitch	in his	jaw,	or	any	number	of	other	possibilities.	If	you	really	can't	see	it,	try	to	look at	 your	kid	through	squinty	eyes,	if	that	makes	sense.	You	know	those	optical illusion	posters	where	you	have	to	find	the	fish	in	the	psychedelic	colors,	and the	only	way	to	find	the	fish	is	to	squint?	Yeah,	it's	kind	of	like	that.	So	many parents	get	focused	on	the	genitals-makes	sense,	since	that's	where	the	eagle	is landing-or	they	have	an	expectation	of	what	the	signal	is	going	to	be.	Let	the preconceived	notions	go.	Just	watch	with	squinty	eyes.	And	above	all,	keep	your child's	pee	pattern	in	mind.	If	you	know	approximately	when	the	pee	should	be coming,	it	makes	it	easier	to	watch	for	the	signal.

Sir	Dribbles-a-Lot: This	kid	is	a	dripping	faucet.	I	mostly	see	dribblers	in	boys, which	kind	of	figures,	 yeah?	 They	 can	 dribble	 a	 lot	 throughout	 the	 day,	 or	 it might	occur	right	before	they	have	to	pee.	This	is	not	terribly	worrisome	in	the first	 few	 days.	 You	 have	 to	 remember	 that	 yesterday,	 when	 and	 how	 to	 pee wasn't	on	his	radar.	Today	he's	getting	used	to	a	whole	new	ballgame.	We	don't know	for	sure	 how	 your	 child	 peed	 when	 he	 was	 wearing	 a	 diaper.	 He	 might have	let	the	pee	out	a	little	at	a	time	until	the	diaper	was	full.	For	this	kid,	part of	potty	training	is	a	natural	consolidation	of	those	little	dribbly	pees	into	one bigger	one.	It	generally	happens	naturally	as	they	get	the	hang	of	things.

The	kid	will	not	sit	long	enough	to	pee: This	is	a	very	common	complaint.	Try doing	something	to	engage	her	and	keep	her	attention	while	she's	on	the	potty. I	offer	suggestions	like	singing	a	song,	counting	to	a	particular	number	together (50	is	a	good	one),	or	reading	some	books.	A	great	phrase	to	use	is:	'I	need	to hear more	pee.'	For	some	reason,	this	resonates	with	kids	better	than	'sit	and finish	 your	 pee.'	 I	 think	 it's	 because	 the	 kids	 are	 motivated	 to	 give	 you something	other	than	the	actual	pee.	They	want	to	give	you	the sound of	 pee. What.	Ever.	Toddlers.

But	this	particular	issue	is	also	one	of	the	places	where	parenting	philosophies can	kind	of	muck	things	up.	Your	child	is	getting	to	an	age	of	limit	testing.	You need	to	be	firm	and	let	your	child	know	you	mean	business.	For	some	parents, though,	'being	firm'	feels	sticky.	Let	me	tell	you	that	it's	okay	to	be	firm.	You don't	need	to	be	mean	to	be	firm.	The	less	'dancing	around'	your	child	you	do, the	better.	Sometimes,	parents	go	so	over	the	top	trying	to	get	the	child	to	sit and	pee	that	it	turns	into	serious	entertainment	for	the	kid.	You	don't	want	to set	up	that	habit.	Also,	if	you're	bending	over	backward	to	get	the	kid	to	pee,	it starts	to	smell	like	fear.	Kids	can	smell	fear	a	mile	away,	and	it	will	either	make them fearful	or	they	will	eat	you	for	breakfast.

So	what	can	you	do?	Some	mild	form	of	distraction	is	fine.	I	would	stay	away from	TV,	though.	Don't	put	the	potty	in	front	of	a	video	or	program	and	let your	child	just	sit	there.	It	may	get	them	to	sit,	but	it	is	way	too	passive.	They are	just	getting	the	pee	in	the	potty	by	chance	because	they	happen	to	be	sitting there.	What	they	need	to	be	learning	is	to	act	on	the	feeling	of	having	to	pee.

On	that	 note,	 phone	 games,	 tablets,	 and	 other	 electronic	 devices	 as	 potty entertainment	are	okay	for	the	first	couple	of	days if	you	have	to .	I	don't	suggest them,	but	some	parents	specifically	ask.	Just	don't	make	it	a	habit.	As	with	TV, these	 devices	 make	 the	 peeing/pooping	 passive,	 and	 can	 quickly	 lead	 to manipulation	(the	child	demands	a	reward	in	order	to	pee	or	poop).	My	bottom line	is	that	if	your	child	can	play	a	game	on	a	mobile	device,	your	child	is	more than	capable	of	putting	pee	and	poop	in	the	potty.

Remember,	the	idea	is	to	normalize	the	use	of	the	potty,	not	to	make	it	into	a big	game	or	special	thing.

The	 'Calm	 Jar': This	 is	 a	 distraction	 that	 works	 well	 for	 a	 few	 different situations.	Make	a	Calm	Jar	out	of	a	Mason	jar	or	a	clear	plastic	water	bottle. Fill	it	with	water,	medium-sized	glitter,	and	some	oil	or	glycerin.	The	result	is	a sort	 of	 snow	 globe.	 Many	 parents	 use	 the	 Calm	 Jar	 in	 lieu	 of	 a	 time	 out:	 the child	can	shake	it	and	watch	the	glitter	settle,	which	is	calming	and	relaxing and	takes	a	minute.	I've	found	the	Calm	Jar	to	be	excellent	for	kids	who	want	to pop	right	up	off	the	potty,	because	it	helps	keep	their	interest,	which	keeps	them seated.	 It's	 also	 great	 for	 the	 kid	 who's	 having	 trouble	 releasing	 pee	 or	 poop. This	is	the	kid	who	sits	on	the	potty	but	can't	seem	to	let	the	pee	go;	then	she pops	up	and	pees	on	the	floor.	This	kid	is	not	screwing	with	you,	even	though	it looks	like	it-she	just	needs	to	sit	longer	and	allow	for	the	release.	The	Calm	Jar will	help	her	relax	and	let	the	pee	start	flowing.

Fear	 of	 the	 potty: You've	 been	 casual	 and	 relaxed.	 You	 know	 you	 are	 not putting	any	pressure	on	your	child.	Still,	your	kid	seems	afraid	of	the	potty.	First of	all,	do not invalidate	her	feelings.	Just	like	fear	of	the	dark,	the	monster	under the	bed,	or	the	vacuum,	this	is	a	real	fear	(however	illogical	it	might	be).	We don't	want	to	feed	into	it,	but	we	don't	want	to	invalidate	it.	Never	ask	your child	if	she	is	afraid	of	the	potty.	You	will	get	a	'yes,'	and	there's	nowhere	to	go from	there.	Instead,	tell	her	something	along	the	lines	of,	'Honey,	I	know	this can	feel	weird.	I	know	it's	brand-new.	Look	at	the	potty.	See?	It's	just	plastic.' Let	her	practice	pouring	some	water	into	it	and	dumping	it	into	the	big	toilet. Practice	with	some	toys	or	dolls,	having	her	'help'	them	use	the	potty.	I've	even had	moms	sit	right	on	the	darn	thing	and	pee	to	show	it's	not	gonna	bite	(very bendy	moms,	I	should	add).	You	can	even	have	her	sit	on	it	(when	she	doesn't need	to	go	pee)	for	practice.	Again,	don't	feed	into	the	fear	but	do	acknowledge it.	Acknowledgment	goes	a	long	way	with	kids.	This	is	one	of	those	times	to	use an	'and'	sentence	construct:	'Yes,	I	know	it	feels	strange and that's	where	your pee	goes.'	Yes	and	yes.

Also,	check	out	my	musings	on	this	subject	in	chapter	10,	'Poop.'	There	are many	things	that	contribute	to	potty	fear.	You	have	to	work	through	this	fear, and	it	may	take	a	fair	amount	of	creativity.	Just	as	fearing	a	monster	under	the bed	doesn't	mean	you	don't	go	to	bed,	fear	of	the	potty	doesn't	mean	you	put	a diaper	back	on.	Also,	try	to	pin	down	the	fear.	Is	she	afraid	of	the	potty	itself	or the	sensation	of	pooping?	It	helps	to	know	what's	worrying	her	so	you	can	deal with	it	more	specifically.

Also,	you'll	want	to	identify	whether	you're	looking	at	a	case	of	true	fear	or just	a	little	bit	of	resistance.	The	child	with	a	true,	deep	fear	of	the	potty	is	rare and	should	be	distinguished	from	a	child	who	is	showing	resistance.	In	the	case of	a	child	with	a	true	fear,	the	potty	might	as	well	be	filled	with	boiling,	molten lava-she	wants	no	part	of	it.	The	truly	afraid	child	is	the	one	who,	right	from the	get-go,	shrieked	and	hollered	and	had	to	be	dragged	to	the	potty.	Note	that a	 true	 fear	 shows	 up	 right	 from	 the	 start	 of	 potty	 training.	 A	 child	 who	 starts resisting	after	using	the	potty	a	couple	of	times	isn't	truly afraid .	Many	children show	resistance	to	the	potty.	Fear	is	something	different.	You	will	recognize	it	if you	see	it,	but	you're	not	likely	to.	In	all	my	years,	of	all	the	kids	I've	worked with,	only	eleven	have	fallen	into	this	category.	I	hesitate	even	to	mention	it because	I	don't	want	everyone	saying,	'This	is	my	kid.'	I'll	talk	more	about	the truly	fearful	child	in	chapter	17,	'Special	Circumstances.'

So,	 are	 you	 sensing	 a	 theme	 here?	 In	 case	 you're	 too	 exhausted	 to	 put	 it together,	 I'll	 spell	 it	 out. Nothing is	 'wrong'	 the	 first	 day	 of	 potty	 training. Yesterday,	 your	 kid	 could	 pee	 and	 poop	 whenever,	 wherever	 the	 urge	 struck. Now,	you	 aren't	 letting	 him	 out	 of	 your	 sight,	 and	 he	 is	 expected	 to	 up	 and make	this	huge	change.	Just	remember	that.

Also,	never	underestimate	the	power	of	sleep.	Much	will	be	accomplished	in his	sleep	tonight.	Information	gets	sorted	out	in	the	brain,	and	you	can	begin fresh	in	the	morning.

If	 you	 feel	 that	 Block	 One	 went	 pretty	 well-that	 there	 was	 some	 forward movement	 and	 some	 clicking-rock	 on.	 That's	 awesome.	 Move	 on	 to	 Block Two:	pants,	commando,	and	small	outings.	If	you	are	feeling	less-than-stellar	or simply	a	little	unsure,	it's	okay	to	bounce	a	little	from	Block	One	to	Block	Two. I	recommend	having	your	child	go	half	naked	and	half	clothed.	I	call	it	.	.	.

## Handing	Your	Child	Success

Often,	parents	are	just	not	really	sure	where	their	kid	is	at	with	regard	to	taking everything	 in	 during	 the	 early	 phases	 of	 potty	 training.	 If	 you	 fall	 into	 this category,	it's	okay	to	do	more	naked	time.	To	make	progress,	though,	we	need	to start	 stacking	 up	 successes.	 This	 will	 build	 your	 child's	 pride	 and	 confidence. Learning	to	use	the	potty	is	a	lot	like	learning	to	read.	You	can't	just	learn	a letter	and	move	on.	You	have	to	study	the	letter,	hear	it	again	and	again,	and write	it	in	lower	and	upper	case	many,	many	times.	(I	have	a	small	rain	forest	in worksheets	that	prove	this.)	To	create	progress	in	potty	training,	you	have	to nudge	 the	 child	 forward	 with	 the	 expectation	 that	 they	 can	 rise	 to	 the	 next challenge,	 but	 you	 also	 have	 to	 know	 they've	 gotten	 the	 last	 step.	 It's	 a balancing	act,	to	be	sure.

One	way	to	hand	your	child	success	in	Block	Two	is	to	start	with	your	child naked	(at	least	from	the	waist	down)	and	make	sure	you	get	a	good	pee	in	the potty.	 Then	throw	on	some	clothes	for	a	very	small	outing.	Bracket	the	day's activities	around	pees,	trying	to	ensure	that	you're	home	and	your	child	has	a naked	bum	for	the	times	when	he	needs	to	go.	Between	pees,	do	small	errands	or activities	outside.	Many	parents	feel	like	this	is	cheating,	but	it's	not.	Or	it	is, and	I	don't	care.	The	most	valuable	outcome	here	is	that	your	child	will	feel pride	and	accomplishment. These	will	provide	the	ongoing	motivation.

Between	Block	One	and	Block	Two,	parents	often	try	to	rush	things	a	bit. Get	pants	on	the	kid.	Get	out	of	the	house.	Get	the	kid	fully	potty	trained.	Part of	the	reason	for	clearing	your	social	calendar	is	to	be	able	to	be	able	to	have	an, 'Eh,	 whatever,'	 attitude	 about	 the	 whole	 thing.	 If	 you	 rush	 things,	 you'll	 be kicking	out	those	blocks	of	success!	They	are	vital.	Without	them,	your	tower	is going	to	be	very	unstable,	if	it	stands	at	all.	Take	your	time	and	set	your	child	up to	succeed.

Another	thing:	be	sure you are	taking	care	of	yourself.	Yes,	this	can	be	tiring. Yes,	have	some	wine.	But	do	not	stay	up	late	or	eat	a	ton	of	junk.	We	need	you sane	and	rested	so	you	can	be	the	most	effective	teacher	possible,	yeah?

## CHAPTER	8

## Block	Two	and	Three	Dilemmas

A t	 this	 point,	 you	 should	 feel	 pretty	 comfortable	 that	 your	 child,	 while	 bare bummed,	 can	 sit	 and	 pee	 on	 the	 potty.	 Remember:	 it's	 okay	 if	 you	 are	 still prompting.	 Prompting	 counts	 as	 success,	 and	 your	 child	 needs	 it.	 Remember, though:	don't	overprompt	(she	says	to	the	mom	holding	a	knife).	By	now,	you may	have	started	with	pants,	or	your	child	may	still	be	butt	nekkid,	or	you	may be	doing	a	mix	of	the	two.

## Resistance!!!	(Woo-hoo!)

This	phase	of	potty	training	can	bring	about	resistance.	Regardless	of	what	block you	are	on,	resistance	usually	hits	on	the	second	day	of	potty	training.	Your	kid is	 thinking,	 'This	 was	 okay	 when	 we	 started.	 But	 now	 .	 .	 .	 oh	 no,	 you	 might possibly	 be	 serious	 about	 this	 peeing-in-the-potty	 thing.'	 The	 second	 day	 of potty	training	is	most	commonly	the	day	when	parents	without	a	plan	(ahem, this	 book)	 give	 up.	 They	 think	 the	 resistance	 is	 a	 sign	 that	 the	 child	 is	 not ready.	In	reality,	nothing	could	be	farther	from	the	truth.	If	your	child	is	able	to put	up	a	fight	for	something	he	wants,	he's	more	than	ready	to	put	his	pee	in	the potty.

I	simply	cannot	tell	you	how	many	times	I	hear	some	version	of	what	former client	 Aislinn	 wrote:	 'I	 can't	 believe	 it!	 This	 looked	 like	 SUCH	 a	 disaster.	 I swear	 I	 was	 ready	 to	 give	 up.	 Thank	 god	 I	 didn't!	 Working	 through	 that resistance	was	not	fun	but	now	it's	the	fourth	day	and	she's	GOT	IT!	Yahoo!'

The	biggest	reason	for	resistance	is	that	you're	'on	it'	too	hard	with	your	kid. You	probably	don't	even	realize	how	much	pressure	you're	putting	on	your	child, but	 most	 parents	 go	 through	 this	 at	 some	 point.	 You	 can't	 help	 it.	 You	 have potty	on	the	brain,	and	you	are	on	edge.	If	your	kid	is	resisting,	you	are	most likely	overprompting.

Remember	those	two	posts	you	read	about	prompting	and	backing	off?	The ones	 I	 said	 were	 really	 important?	 The	 ones	 you	 probably	 read	 way	 back	 two weeks	ago,	when	you	were	thinking	about	potty	training	in	theory	but	weren't actually	doing	it	yet?	Yeah.	Read	them	again,	now	that	you're	in	the	thick	of	it. I'm	not	kidding	when	I	say	most	problems	can	be	solved	with	the	information contained	 in	 those	 two	 posts.	 They'll	 help	 you	 strike	 the	 balance	 between overprompting	and	backing	off.

For	 some	 children,	 everything	 'clicks'	 during	 the	 first	 few	 days	 of	 potty training,	but	for	a	good	majority	it	doesn't.	Before	we	get	to	actual	dilemmas,	we need	to	review	a	few	things.	First,	remember	that	all	this	was	absolutely	not	on your	 child's	 radar	 a	 couple	 of	 days	 ago.	 I	 know	 I	 keep	 saying	 that,	 but	 it's important	for	you	to	really	hear	it.	We	have	to	allow	them	time	to	learn	this. Most	parents	realize	this	on	some	level,	but	still	have	a	sort	of	lingering	hope that	everything	will	be	signed,	sealed,	and	delivered	on	the	second	or	third	day. As	 with	 any	 major	 milestone,	 mastering	 the	 potty	 takes	 time,	 and	 having	 a 'potty	prodigy'	is	highly	unlikely.	It	can	happen,	yes.	But	I	don't	want	you	to feel	weird	or	like	you're	doing	a	crappy	job	if	it	doesn't.

Side	 note	 for	 a	 second:	 I	 really	 believe	 potty	 training	 pains	 are	 like	 labor pains.	I	think	they	get	fuzzy	around	the	edges	with	time.	Most	of	the	people	who say	their	kid	upped	and	decided	not	to	wear	diapers	on	his	own	have	a	kid	older than	yours.	Or	they're	new	in	town.	For	whatever	reason,	you	can't	really	verify their	 story.	 I	 hear	 about	 the	 'potty	 prodigy'	 all	 the	 time	 from	 moms	 on	 the playground.	 In	 reality,	 though,	 I	 hang	 around	 with	 a	 lot	 of	 moms	 and	 potty training	is	my	job,	and	I've	yet	to	see	with	my	own	eyes	the	kid	who	just	potty trains	himself	in	hours.	Just	want	you	to	know	that	so	your	head	doesn't	blow off.

Another	 important	 thing	 to	 remember	 is	 that	 every	 child	 has	 her	 own learning	 methods	 and	 curve.	 It's	 okay	 if	 she	 doesn't	 take	 to	 potty	 training	 as quickly	as	you	expected.	It	doesn't	mean	your	child	is	not	smart.

Having	 said	 that,	 here	 are	 some	 very	 common	 problems	 in	 Block	 Two	 of potty	training.

## Peeing	Right	Through	the	Pants

Your	kid	did great with	Block	One. Great. You	knew	she	was	ready	to	move	on. Got	her	up,	took	off	the	diaper,	she	peed	first	thing,	you	put	her	in	some	pants, and	she's	peeing	right	the	hell	through	them	all.	It's	11:30	a.m.	and	you	have seven	pairs	of	soaking	pants.	WTF,	Jamie?

Okay.	Number	one:	does	she	actually	know	how	to	manipulate	her	clothing? This	is	a	very	big	issue,	and	yet	we	all	tend	to	forget	about	it.	I	discussed	it	in chapter	4,	 but	 again,	 you	 probably	 glossed	 over	 it	 because	 it	 didn't	 seem	 very important	two	weeks	ago	when	you	first	read	the	book.	It's	important.	If	she	has to	pee	and	has	trouble	getting	her	pants	down,	she	will	lose	a	few	vital	seconds. You	want	her	to	practice	actually	pushing	her	pants	down	when	she doesn't need to	use	the	potty	so	the	skill	is	in	place	when	she	does.

Be	sure	she's	in	very	loose,	elastic-waist	pants	or	shorts	or	leggings.	For	girls, dresses	with	no	panties	work	great.	For	boys,	boxers	are	pretty	magical,	but	make sure	 he	 is	 commando.	 This	 means	 he's	 wearing	 boxers	 and	 only	 boxers,	 not boxers	as	undies.	The	idea	behind	this	is	that	they	need	as	little	fabric	on	the bum	 as	 possible.	 Again,	 I	 know	 we	 talked	 about	 this	 already,	 but	 it's	 worth repeating.

## The	Feeling	of	Having	to	Go	Pee

Start	using	the	phrase	'The	feeling	of	having	to	go	pee	.	.	.'	with	your	child. Some	kids	 don't	 realize	 they	 need	 first	 to feel	 it ,	 then	 make	 the	 move	 to	 the potty,	 then	 take	 the	 pants	 down,	 then	 sit	 and	 pee.	 Most	 kids	 respond	 best	 to short,	direct	commands.	You	don't	have	to	bark	this	out	like	you're	training	a dog,	 but	 be	 short	 and	 direct,	 and	 state	 things in	 the	 order	 you	 would	 like	 them done .	This	is	vital.	Potty	training	is	the	first	thing	your	child	is	learning	that	has a	set	order	with	only	one	desirable	outcome.	That	order	can	get	mixed	up,	so make	sure	your	kid	is	clear:	Go.	Pants.	Sit.	Pee.

Many	kids	hear	you	say,	'Go	pee!'	and	they	do.	It	always	reminds	me	of	that old	movie Parenthood ,	 with	Steve	Martin.	His	daughter	feels	sick,	and	he	says, 'Honey,	do	you	feel	like	you	have	to	throw	up?'	And	she	says,	'Okay'	and	pukes all	over	him.	Yeaaah.	You	want	specific,	short	directions	to	indicate	what	they should	be	doing.

Let's	look	at	other	versions	of	the	peeing	through	pants.	Sometimes,	it's	just that	your	child	hasn't	nailed	that	first	block	of	learning.	He	should	be	able	to pee	on	the	potty	when	prompted	or	on	his	own	naked.	If	he	can't/won't	do	that, you	 should	 hold	 off	 the	 pants.	 Don't	 try	 to	 rush	 pants,	 and	 don't	 think	 of wearing	pants	as	a	marker	of	success.	It's	simply	the	next	block	of	learning.	We can't	 stack	 the	 'pants	 block'	 until	 we	 get	 the	 'naked	 block'	 down.	 Now	 you don't,	 of	 course,	 want	 a	 potty-trained-when-naked	 kid,	 so	 you	 will	 need	 to nudge	the	process	along.	If	you	are	unsure	of	what	to	do,	try	pants.	If	the	pants get	wet,	'hand	your	child	success,'	as	I	discussed	at	the	end	of	the	last	chapter.

If	you	think	your	child	is	trying	to	get	to	the	potty,	but	just	isn't	making	it, keep	 going.	 Trying	 but	 not	 making	 it	 in	 time	 is	 a	 really	 good	 sign!	 If	 she	 is wetting	through	a	few	pairs	of	pants	but	you	still	feel	pretty	hopeful,	keep	going. I've	had	so	many	parents	echo	what	former	client	Amy	said:

'I	 just	 wanted	 to	 offer	 hope	 to	 those	 who	 may	 be	 feeling	 unsuccessful.	 The	 first	 couple	 of	 days resulted	in	many	accidents.	My	daughter	Katherine	(twenty-two	months)	would	start	to	pee	on	the floor,	stop	when	I	told	her	to	hold	it,	not	pee	on	the	pot,	and	then	have	an	accident	right	afterwards. Day	two	resulted	in	nine	pairs	of	pants	in	seven	hours	(and	two	bare-bottomed	accidents,	as	Kat	liked being	naked).	The	thing	that	helped	me	the	most	after	the	first	couple	of	days	was	reading	your	blog entry	about	how	parents	have	to	be	committed	to	this	and	not	think	that	she	wasn't	ready	yet	and	to wait	a	few	more	months.	This	morning	I	had	a	renewed	resolve	that	this	was	it.	I	reminded	Kat	that she's	a	big	girl	now	and	doesn't	use	diapers	anymore	(except	for	sleeping,	but	I	didn't	remind	her	of that).	She's	acting	like	a	big	girl	at	mealtimes,	too,	not	wanting	to	wear	a	bib	and	wanting	to	use grown-up	utensils	&amp;	plates!	This	has	only	been	since	potty	training.	She's	been	nursing	more	often today,	but	I	think	all	the	big	girl	responsibility	is	getting	to	her.	I	have	to	remind	myself	not	to	call her	my	baby.	I	just	wanted	to	say	thank	you,	Jamie!	And	I'm	so	glad	I	stuck	it	out!'

Wet	pants	can	be	part	of	 the	 learning	 process.	 Overall,	 if	 the	 child	 is	 not getting	pee	in	the	potty,	what	you	should	be	looking	for	are	signs	of:

Distaste: they	should	feel	yucky	and	it	should	register.

Apologetic:

any	version	of	sorry.

Dismay: they	are	bothered	that	this	happened.

Hiding :	they	are	trying	to	hide	it	from	you	(this	can	also	be	flat-out	denial	that	they	peed	their	pants).

Any	of	those	signs	show	that	your	child	is	aware	of	and	has	negative	feelings about	peeing	her	pants.	This	is	when	you	would	use	the	half	naked/half	clothed technique.	 She	 probably	 needs	 a	 tiny	 bit	 more	 learning	 and	 a	 bit	 more confidence	in	her	own	abilities.

If	your	child	pees	her	pants	and	registers	nothing	at	all,	it's	definitely	time	for another	naked	day.	At	least	one	more.	Remember	the	timeline:	Clueless	to	I Peed	to	I'm	Peeing	to	I	Have	to	Go	Pee.

## Still	No	Poop

Okay,	so	you're	on	Block	Two	and	you	still	haven't	gotten	a	poop.	Your	child may	be	showing	signs	of	discomfort	and/or	crankiness.	Keep	your	eyes	peeled; you	can	be	sure	a	poop	is	coming	eventually. Be	watchful	when	transitioning	into pants	if	you	don't	have	a	poop	yet. The	illusion	of	privacy	that	pants	provide	is	a cue	for	them	to	just	do	it	in	their	pants.

Even	on	the	second	day,	no	poop	is	very	common.	It's	okay,	don't	panic.	One of	the	biggest	problems	with	lack	of	poop	is	that	you,	the	parent,	start	to	freak out	and	get	anxious.	You	also	start	hovering	and	slip	into	overprompting.	Head over	to	chapter	10,	'Poop,'	for	more	information.

## Full-blown	Tantrums

These	are	not	unheard	of	in	a	two-year-old	who	is	not	getting	her	way.	In	this particular	 case,	 'her	 way'	 is	 a	 diaper/routine/everything	 back	 the	 way	 it	 was. Here's	the	thing	with	tantrums:	they	aren't	very	satisfying	for	your	child	if	you aren't	 tugging	 at	 the	 other	 end	 of	 the	 proverbial	 rope.	 Here's	 a	 typical	 potty training	tantrum	situation:	You	prompt	her	to	go	pee	on	the	potty.	As	you	are making	 your	 way	 to	 her,	 she	 throws	 herself	 down	 on	 the	 floor,	 immediately becomes	either	superrigid	or	wet	spaghetti-ish,	starts	screaming	if	you	touch	her, and	.	.	.	you	know	the	drill.	Here's	the	fix:	prompt.	As	in	'remind	and	then	walk away.'	The	only	reason	she's	putting	on	a	show	is	that	you	are	watching,	front and	 center.	 If	 you	 prompt	 her,	 leave	 it	 at	 that,	 and really walk	 away-yes,	 it sounds	 risky-you	 are	 giving	 her	 space	 and	 time	 to	 make	 a	 good	 decision	 for herself.	If	she	is	busy	fighting	you,	all	her	energy	is	being	used	in	fighting	you rather	than	in	making	a	good	decision.	So,	prompt	and	walk	away.	Never	does	a child	have	a	tantrum	in	an	empty	room.	The	nature	of	the	beast	is	that	someone must	be	watching.

## The	Bedtime	Potty	Pit

You	 know	 how	 in	 the	 game	 Candy	 Land	 there	 are	 these	 pits	 like	 the	 gooey Chocolate	Swamp	that	you	can	get	stuck	in?	Yeah	.	.	.	in	potty	training	there's	a classic	one	I	call	the	'Bedtime	Potty	Pit.'

It	 can	 occur	 at	 two	 possible	 times:	 before	 giving	 up	 nighttime	 diapers	 and after	 giving	 up	 nighttime	 diapers.	 For	 brevity,	 I'll	 refer	 to	 nighttime	 only,	 but the	same	applies	for	nap	time.

It	looks	something	like	this:	Aaron	does	great	all	day	long.	His	mom,	Angela, can	now	trust	him	to	use	the	potty	during	the	day.	He	either	tells	her	he	has	to go	or	does	a	really	clear	pee-pee	dance.	Daytime	is	all	set.	Aaron's	bedtime	is 7:30.	 There	 are	 the	 usual	 three	 stories	 and	 two	 songs.	 Dad's	 in	 charge	 of brushing	teeth	and	pjs.	Everything	looks	pretty	good,	almost	out	of	a	Lifetime movie.	Then	Aaron	says,	'I	have	to	pee.'	Okay.	Pjs	off,	night	diaper	off,	Aaron sits	to	pee.	Shockingly,	there's	no	pee.	Diaper	back	on.	Pjs	back	on.	Tuck	Aaron in	.	.	.	almost	out	of	the	room.	'Pee!	I	got	to	pee!'	Pjs	off.	Diaper	off.	Sit	to	pee. Hmm.	No	pee.	You	can	rinse,	lather,	and	repeat	for	.	.	.	oh	.	.	.	however	many times	you	can	imagine.	Even	better	is	the	poop	call,	'cause	that	just	might	lead to,	let's	say,	forty	minutes	of	reading	to	Aaron	on	the	potty	all	for	a	poop.

It's	 classic.	 And	 freaking	 exhausting.	 Now,	 it's	 8:30	 and	 well	 past	 bedtime, which	 makes	 for	 the	 most	 charming	 behavior.	 But	 what	 do	 you	 do?	 Do	 you honor	 the	 pee	 and	 poop	 call?	 I	 mean,	 you've	 done	 all	 this	 hard	 work,	 right? What	if	he	means	it?	But	what	if	he	doesn't?

My	experience	is	that	the	Bedtime	Potty	Pit	(BPP)	is	a	fabulous	stall.	Aaron has	 Mom	and	Dad	by	the	balls,	 and	 he	 knows	 it.	 Never	 in	 his	 short	 life	 has Aaron	had	the	kind	of	power	he	has	now.	Mom	and	Dad	jump	when	he	says	he has	to	pee.	Aaron	is	not	dumb;	in	fact,	he's	very	smart.	He's	going	to	use	that power	as	much	as	possible,	largely	for	entertainment.

If	you're	caught	in	the	BPP,	give	your	child	three	chances	(or	however	many you	have	predetermined).	Let	your	child	know	that	he	has	a	certain	number	of chances.	You	might	say	something	like,	'Aaron,	this	is	the	last	time	you	will	sit to	pee.	If	you	don't	have	to	pee,	you	can	hold	it	until	Mommy	comes	and	gets you	 in	 the	 morning.'	 He	 may	 or	 may	 not	 pee.	 You	 don't	 want	 to	 say,	 'Last chance,	or	you're	stuck	doing	in	it	your	diapers.'	At	least	introduce	the	notion that	he	can	hold	it	and	that	it	is	up	to	him.	He	has	a	choice:	A	or	B.

The	other	thing	you	should	do	if	it	looks	like	your	child	might	use	the	BPP stall	is	to	start	bedtime	early	enough	to	factor	it	in.	For	Aaron,	that	might	mean starting	the	whole	bedtime	routine	around	6:45.	Remember,	this	is	temporary! You	all	will	find	your	groove	soon	enough.	If	you	build	in	time	for	the	stall,	you will	 be	 so	 much	 less	 likely	 to	 get	 anxious	 about	 it.	 The	 stalls	 are	 annoying enough	on	their	own,	but	in	addition,	we	get	anxious	because	bedtime	is	being put	off,	and	we	know	the	kid	needs	his	sleep	or	we're	stuck	with	the	fallout	the next	day.	So	allow	yourself	plenty	of	wiggle	room.

Don't	be	afraid	of	laying	down	some	firm	boundaries.	Once	he	has	nothing	to push	against,	the	game	really	isn't	fun.	As	always,	do	this	is	in	a	calm,	casual manner.	Even	if	he	calls	out	one	last	time	to	pee	as	you're	leaving	the	room,	you can	say,	'Okay,	hold	it	till	morning.	I	love	you.	Good	night.'	This	way,	you've acknowledged	 that	 you've	 heard	 him	 and	 that	 you	 believe	 him	 (even	 if	 you don't),	but	you	laid	down	some	boundaries	and	you're	sticking	to	them.	This, my	friend,	is	good	parenting.

And	you	don't	have	to	be	concerned	if	 he	 does	 pee	 in	 his	 diaper;	 it's	 not going	to	screw	with	the	process.	It's	a	minor	behavioral	speed	bump.	Deal	with the	stall	game	first,	then	tackle	the	nighttime	potty	training.

Of	course,	this	all	gets	much	trickier	without	a	nighttime	diaper,	because	you have	the	very	real	fear	that	your	kid	will	pee	in	the	bed.	You	never	want	to	lead with	fear!	The	best	thing	to	do	is	to	leave	the	potty	chair	in	his	room,	and	after the	bedtime	routine,	say,	'Good	night.	I	love	you.	If	you	need	to	pee,	your	potty is	 right	 there.'	If	your	child	senses	you	are	fearful	and	unsure,	I	can	guarantee this	will	become	a	game	for	him.

I've	found	that	for	the	bedtime	routine	in	general,	just	be	sure	to	leave	room for	all	the	antics.	Playfully	ask	her	as	part	of	the	routine,	'Did	you	have	your	last glass	of	water?	What	shall	the	last	story	be?	Go	for	your	last	pee.	Brush	your	last tooth.	Thank	you.'	The	one	thing	that	never,	ever,	ever	helps	is	getting	angry or	 annoyed.	 This	 will	 rile	 up	 both	 you	 and	 your	 child,	 and	 you'll	 accomplish nothing	other	than	to	keep	the	kid	awake.

## Power	Struggles

There's	 another	 huge	 issue	 involved	 in	 potty	 training	 troubles:	 the	 power struggle.	 Power	 struggles	 can	 make	 things	 a	 little	 crazy	 in	 your	 house.	 The average	 family	 deals	 with	 several	 power	 struggles	 on	 a	 daily	 basis,	 so	 potty training	power	struggles	should	come	as	no	surprise.	Still,	it's	best	to	avoid	them if	possible,	which	is	why	it's	so	important	to	avoid	hovering	or	overprompting. Both	lead	to	power	struggles.

Should	you	find	 yourself	 facing	 a	 power	 struggle,	 you	 need	 to	 identify	 and remove	whatever	is	creating	it.	This	is	because-let	me	be	very	clear	here-you cannot	and	will	not	ever	win	a	potty	training	power	struggle	with	a	toddler.

I	remember	a	classic	one	I	had	with	Pascal.	He	was	about	two	feet	away	from me,	and	I	asked	him	to	come	over	to	me	in	a	casual	tone.	He	responded,	'No, you	come	here.'	I	followed	with,	'No,	you	come	here.'	We	kept	going	back	and forth,	and	as	I	started	digging	in	my	heels,	so	did	he.	Finally,	I	was	able	to	put	on my	grown-up	brain	for	a	minute	and	realize	we	were	in	fight about	two	feet	of space .	.	.	and	I	didn't	even	really	need	him	to	come	to	me!	Geez	Louise!	Come on,	Mommy.

Don't	even	try	to	tell	me	that	something	similar	hasn't	happened	to	you.	So, as	 you	 can	 imagine,	 if	 power	 struggles	 can	 erupt	 over	 nothing,	 think	 of	 the power	struggle	potential	of	something	as	big	and	loaded	as	potty	training!	It's	a natural	hotbed	for	a	struggle.

Also,	unlike	other	potential	causes	of	power	struggles,	when	it	comes	to	potty training,	 your	 child	 truly	 does	 hold	 THE	 POWER,	 in	 a	 very	 literal	 way.	 We sometimes	feel	like	our	whole	world	revolves	around	and	is	controlled	by	our kids.	The	reality,	though,	is	they	have	no	control	at	all.	We	tell	them	where, when,	why,	and	how	to	do	practically	everything.	This	is	normal.	Their	bodily functions,	though,	are	one	thing	we	don't	control!	They	hold	the	pee	(or	poop), so	they	hold	the	power.

If	 we	 look	 at	 a	 power	 struggle	 as	 a	 tug-of-war,	 the	 absolute	 best	 way	 out	 of one	is	to	let	go	of	your	end	of	the	rope.	This	does	not	mean	you	cave	in	to	what your	child	wants;	it	means	you	let	go	of	your	need	to	control	the	situation.	Most often	with	toddlers,	power	struggles	arise	out	of	a	desire	to	'do	it	myself.'	This	is true	 of	 potty	 training	 as	 well.	 Whenever	 you	 find	 yourself	 engaged	 in	 a	 potty training	power	struggle,	the	way	you	'let	go	of	your	end	of	the	rope'	is	to	allow your	child	to	make	using	the	potty	his	idea.	For	instance,	you	could	use	one	of those	 'throwaway	 prompts'	 I	 have	 talked	 about	 in	 previous	 chapters.	 Prompt and	back	off.	You	do	not	want	to	hammer	home	your	point	or	keep	repeating the	same	thing	again	and	again.	It	won't	work	and	things	will	escalate.

## Too	Much	Talking

Yes.	 Talking	 to	 your	 child	 is	 good.	 And	 yes,	 telling	 your	 child	 what	 you	 are doing	 as	 you	 are	 doing	 it	 is	 good.	 But	 like	 all	 things,	 talking	 is	 good	 in moderation.	 There's	 a	 current	 parenting	 trend	 that	 seems	 to	 favor	 a	 little too much	 talking.	 Some	 parents	 want	 to	 explain	 every	 little	 thing,	 giving	 a minidissertation	 about	 everything	 that	 happens.	 Some	 of	 this,	 I	 think,	 comes from	us	trying	too	hard	to	teach	'actively.'	Also,	some	of	it-particularly	when it	comes	to	potty	training-is	to	mask	our	own	fear.

Here's	the	thing:	as	long	as	you	are	talking,	you	are	not	listening.	Also,	as long	as	you	are	talking,	you	are	not	letting	your	child	talk	to	himself.	Self-talk	is crucial	to	language	and	thought	development.	Self-talk	is	what	helps	your	child learn	to	control	his	impulses.	Self-talk	develops	with	your	child	and	becomes	his inner	 voice.	 Some	 experts	 suggest	 that	 children	 who	 develop	 strong	 self-talk skills	make	better	choices	throughout	childhood.	We	may	be	talking	about	pee and	poop	right	now,	but	eventually,	it's	going	to	be	smoking	and	drugs	and	sex. With	the	constant	barrage	of	noise	around	us	in	modern	society,	adding	our	own voices	to	the	cacophony	is	not	always	helpful.	When	your	child	talks	to	himself, he's	sorting	out	all	the	information	he	takes	in	and	is	making	it	his	own.	He's learning	to	make	good	decisions for	himself .	If	you	are	talking,	this	can't	happen.

Furthermore,	 when	 you're	 talking	 to	 your	 child-about	 potty	 training	 or anything	else-you're	generally	also	worrying	about	things	along	the	lines	of:	'Is he	even	listening?	Or	comprehending?'	This	adds	another	layer	to	the	talking problem.	There's	emotion	under	all	that	talking.	With	regard	to	potty	training, that	emotion	is	most	likely	fear	and	anxiety	(on	your	part).	Children	attend	to your	vibe	far	above	your	words.

The	bottom	line	is	that	most	parents	talk	endlessly	to	their	children	about the	steps	involved	in	potty	training.	And	most	of	the	time,	the	kid	can	recite those	steps	right	back	to	you.	If	your	child	can	tell	you	where	the	pee	and	poop go,	but	he's	still	peeing	on	the	floor,	it's	time	to	stop	talking.	Instead,	use	simple directives	without	a	lot	of	explanation.	Then	be	quiet	to	give	your	child	room	to process	the	information	for	himself.

Having	Trouble	with	Releasing	or	Hating	the	Potty

## The	Red	Solo	Cup	Trick

The	 Red	 Solo	 Cup	 Trick	 to	 the	 rescue.	 Made	 famous	 by	 country	 music	 and drinking college students everywhere. It is oh-so-much more than an unbreakable	drinking	container.	It	is	also	a	most	excellent	Insta-Porta-Potty.

Don't	laugh,	I'm	serious.

Now,	first	off	.	.	.	it	doesn't	have	to	be	red	or	Solo	brand.	Any	wide-mouth, deep	container	will	do.	And	clearly,	this	is	a	better	trick	for	boys	.	.	.	but	actually can	work	surprisingly	well	for	girls,	too.

I personally discovered	 the RSC	 idea	 because	 I	 have	 one	 bathroom. Invariably-and	I	do	mean	always-the	minute	I	would	sit	to	pee,	my	son	would announce	that	he	also	had	to	pee.	He	was	well	beyond	the	little	potty	stage	by this	 time,	 and	 I	 really	 didn't	 want	 to	 encourage	 peeing	 in,	 say,	 the	 tub.	 So	 I started	keeping	a	RSC	under	the	sink,	tucked	away	so	guests	didn't	ask	questions and	no	one	could	mistake	it	for	a	drinking	vessel.

Here	are	just	a	few	additional	ideas	for	the	Red	Solo	Cup:

In	the	early	stages	of	potty	training,	the	cup	is	great	if	your	child	needs	some 'switching	up';	sometimes	they	start	resisting	the	potty	just	because	they're	sick of	all	the	hoopla	around	it.

The	 RSC	 is	 good	 if	 you	 have	 a	 child	 who's	 having	 trouble	 relaxing	 and releasing	 the	 pee.	 The	 cup	 allows	 him	 to	 focus	 only	 on	 releasing,	 rather	 than having	to	worry	about	sitting,	too.

It	 is	 easy	 to	 keep	 a	 cup	 in	 every	 room,	 just	 for	 emergencies.	 Remember,	 at first	you	only	have	a	few	seconds'	warning	to	get	to	the	potty.

If	 your	 child	 is	 resistant	 to	 leaving	 the	 activity	 he's	 immersed	 in,	 you	 can offer	the	cup	as	a	choice.

If	your	child	is	in	the	tub	and	announces	she	has	to	pee,	have	the	cup	handy. Pee	is	sterile	and	it's	perfectly	fine	for	your	child	to	pee	in	the	tub,	but	if	she	is asking,	it's	best	to	honor	the	request	and	respond.	The	RSC	lets	you	avoid	the whole	 soaking-wet-transfer	 to	 the	 potty	 and	 back	 to	 the	 tub	 (which	 usually creates	so	much	commotion	that	she	can't	relax	and	release	the	pee	once	she's on	the	toilet	anyway).

The	RSC	is	also	handy	to	keep	in	the	car	for	a	quick	pee	before	arriving	to	or after	leaving	from	somewhere.	(Do	yourself	a huge	favor and	keep	a	Mason/Ball jar	with	a	lid	in	the	car,	just	in	case.	At	the	beach	or	lake-or	in	a	snowsuitit's	 easy	 to	 pull	 out	 and	 let	 your	 kid	 do	 their	 business	 with	 hardly	 anyone noticing.

Sometimes	for	kids	who	are	just	not	loving	the	potty,	the	RSC	is	simply	more fun.

A	lot	of	parents	balk	at	the	idea	of	having	their	kid	pee	in	a	cup.	A	lot	of parents	also	find	out	that	this	is	a	great	trick	and	soon	start	worrying	that	their child	will only ever	pee	in	a	cup.	The	RSC	trick	is	a	temporary	bridge	to	using the	potty.	I	have never come	across	a	child	who	stuck	with	the	trick	for	a	weird period	of	time.

## The	Hover	Within	the	Prompt

So,	 you	 carefully	 read	 the	 two	 posts	 in	 an	 earlier	 chapter	 on	 prompting	 and backing	off.	You	feel	very	confident	that	you	are	not	overprompting,	but	you	are still seeing some	 resistance	 to	 your	 occasional	 prompts.	 What's	 probably happening	is	that	you	are	hovering	after	prompting.	You	may	be	prompting	your child	and	then	standing	there,	waiting	or	physically	taking	him	to	the	pottydepending	on	his	age,	you	may	need	to	do	this,	but	if	he's	older	than	twenty-four months,	you	don't-and	watching	over	him	to	make	sure	he	sits	and	pees.	The trick	is	to	prompt/remind,	and	then walk	away (just	as	you	do	when	you're	facing a	tantrum).	It	can	feel	risky,	but	you	have	to	leave	room	for	him	to	make	the call.	Think	of	the	prompt	as	a	reminder,	not	as	a	'make	him	go'	kind	of	thing. There	is	nothing	for	him	to	resist	if	you	act	like	you	don't	care.

As	I've	stated	before,	Blocks	Two	and	Three	are	where	it's	at.	These	are	the heart	 of	 potty	 training.	 You	 should	 be	 feeling	 a	 sense	 of	 progress,	 even	 if	 it's teeny	tiny.	There	may	be	a	day	or	two	during	these	blocks	when	it	looks	like you've	stalled	out	or	even	gone	a	little	backward.	That's	okay.	If	you	are	seeing no	 progress	 at	 all,	 however,	 check	 out	 the	 chapters	 13	 ('Behavior	 vs.	 Potty Training')	and	16	('The	Reset')	before	giving	up.	If	your	child	is	under	twenty months	or	over	thirty	months,	be	sure	to	read	the	chapter	relevant	to	those	ages, too.

## CHAPTER	9

## Block	Four	and	All	the	Rest

T his	chapter	is	about	all	the	weird	little	things	that	can	come	up	late	in	potty training	or	after	potty	training.	You	never	know	when	some	of	these	might	hit, so	I'm	lumping	them	all	here.

## Public	Restrooms

In	 one	 word,	 gross.	 I've	 found	 a	 trick	 that	 works	 well	 for	 both	 boys	 and	 girls: simply	lift	the	toilet	seat	and	have	your	child	stand	on	the	rim	and	pee	straight down	into	the	toilet.	Boys	can	just	pull	out	their	penis,	but	girls	will	need	to take	off	panties	(when	girls	are	standing	with	their	legs	spread	to	straddle	the pot,	 the	 pee	 comes	 out	 in	 a	 straight	 shot).	 This	 only	 works	 for	 pee,	 though; there's	not	much	you	can	do	for	poops	aside	from	having	your	child	sit.	I've	tried holding	kids	behind	the	knees	with	their	butts	sticking	out,	but	this	creates	too much	commotion	for	 most	 kids.	 You	 can	 also	 carry	 minipackets	 of	 sanitizing wipes	or	travel	potty	inserts	(sold	at	any	major	baby	store).	Also,	as	I've	said,	I'm a	huge	proponent	of	bringing	the	potty	in	the	car.	Should	your	child	have	to	go, you're	probably	not	too	far	from	the	car.	Just	remember,	whatever	you	choose	to do,	that	pee	is	sterile	and	poop	is	not.

One	additional	brilliant	tip	from	a	mom:	carry	Post-its	in	your	purse.	You	can use	them	to	cover	up	the	automatic	flusher	sensor	in	public	restrooms	to	prevent them	from	going	off	while	your	child	is	sitting	on	the	potty.	Because	children are	small,	it's	not	uncommon	for	the	flusher	to	go	off	midpoop	otherwise.	Good luck	getting	your	kid	to	use	the	toilet	after	that.

## The	Bloom	Is	off	the	Rose

This	 applies	 if	 you	 have	 a	 kid	 who	 was	 doing	 great	 with	 the	 potty	 and	 then started	having	accidents,	seemingly	out-of-the-blue.	The	honeymoon	is	over.

I	remember	years	ago	when	I	quit	smoking.	The	first	couple	of	months	were easy.	I	was	so	proud	and	got	so	much	support.	If	I	was	bitchy,	I	could	blame	it	on quitting.	 Friends	 checked	 in	 daily.	 But	 then	 that	 tapered	 off.	 I	 had	 become	 a nonsmoker-a	bitchy,	fat	nonsmoker	at	that-and	no	one	gives	you	kudos	for that.	 The	novelty	wore	off.	The	same	thing	happens	with	potty	training.	You think, He's	 got	 this. And	 he	 thinks, I've	 got	 this. And	 as	 he	 gets	 confident, chances	are	he's	just	waiting	a	little	too	long	to	get	to	the	potty.	Handle	it	by going	back	to	some	watching	and	prompting.

This	is	not	to	say	you	have	to	be	on	your	kid	like	you	were	in	the	beginning, but	do	try	to	determine	what's	behind	the	accidents.	A	lot	of	times,	kids	get	very invested	 in	 play	 and	 forget	 to	 go	 or	 don't	 want	 to	 miss	 anything.	 Sometimes they	 simply	 wait	 too	 long	 to	 go	 to	 the	 potty,	 and	 do	 a	 little	 pee-pee	 in	 their pants.	Or	they	can't	get	to	a	bathroom	immediately,	and	the	floodgates	open. For	 ideas	 how	 to	 work	 around	 this,	 see	 chapter	 19,	 'Random	 Tips	 and Questions.'

If	your	child	starts	having	a	lot	of	accidents	out	of	the	blue	and	there	aren't any	obvious	stressors	at	home,	you	might	want	to	look	in	other	places.	Is	there	a new	teacher	at	day	care?	Is	your	child	being	bullied	at	day	care?	Has	his	diet changed	drastically?	Is	there	something	bothering	her?	Oftentimes,	you	can	just ask	your	child	and	she'll	tell	you.	Gentle	questioning	and	being	really	aware	of all	aspects	of	your	child's	life	will	go	a	long	way.	Sometimes,	something	we	think is	trivial	is huge in	a	toddler's	life	(sometimes???).

I'll	use	the	example	of	my	own	son.	He	was	fully	trained	and	then	suddenly started	having	a	couple	of	nighttime	accidents	a	week.	At	that	point,	I	wasn't even	monitoring	his	fluid	intake	before	bed.	He'd	wake	up	to	pee	if	he	had	to. So	this	was	odd,	and	I	started	watching	him	carefully.	I	eventually	figured	out the	accidents	stemmed	from	the	fact	that	he	had	switched	day	cares.	The	switch wasn't	 a	 big	 deal	 to	 him	 in	 and	 of	 itself,	 but	 the	 new	 day	 care	 was	 more structured	than	his	previous	one.	The	kids	drank	fluids	only	at	snack/mealtime, and	even	then,	only	a	Dixie	cup-full.	My	son	didn't	know	he	could	ask	for	more. Instead,	 he	 came	 home	 and	 downed	 five	 huge	 glasses	 of	 water.	 Even	 potty training	all-stars	can't	handle	that	kind	of	fluid	intake	so	late	in	the	day.	Once	I told	him	he	could	ask	for	water	at	day	care	whenever	he	was	thirsty,	he	came home	and	drank	a	normal	amount,	and	the	problem	was	solved.	I	thought	it would	be	obvious	to	him	to	ask	for	more	if	he	was	thirsty,	but	it	wasn't.	(Funny enough,	he	has	no	problem	demanding	more	at	home.)

One	final	thought	on	accidents:	do	not	put	a	diaper	back	on	your	child!	I cannot	 state	 this	 enough.	 Once	 she	 is	 potty	 training,	 even	 in	 the	 beginning stages,	putting	a	diaper	on	your	child	says	one	thing	and	one	thing	only:	'I	don't trust	you.	I'm	telling	you	all	day	that	I	know	you	can	do	it	and	I	have	confidence in	you.	But	really,	I	don't	trust	you.'	This	is	extremely	damaging	to	the	whole process.	If	you	don't	trust	your	child,	she	will	never	trust	herself.

Should	your	child	 have	 an	 accident,	 don't	 punish	 or	 berate	 her.	 Have	 her help	you	clean	it	up	and	reassure	her	that	you	know	she	can	make	it	to	the	potty next	 time.	 Of	 course,	 this	 is	 for	 the	 occasional	 accidents.	 Severe	 regressions indicate	a	big	problem	that	I'll	address	in	chapter	17,	'Special	Circumstances.'

## It's	Not	'Okay'

This	 is	 a	 sticky	 point	 for	 a	 lot	 of	 parents.	 You	 want	 to	 make	 your	 child	 feel comforted	and	accepted,	but	you	must	be	sure	you	are	letting	your	child	know that	it's	not	okay	to	pee	on	the	floor.	If	you	are	more	than	a	couple	of	days	into potty	training	and	you	are	still	ending	up	with	a	lot	of	pee	in	places	besides	the potty,	this	might	be	your	problem.	Many	parents	don't	want	to	use	any	negative language	or	create	any	negative	feelings	around	about	the	potty.	But	the	reality is	that	toddlers	only	think	in	black	and	white;	they	are	incapable	of	thinking	in shades	of	gray.	It's	up	to	you	to	tell	them	what	is	right	and	wrong.	The	way	you do	that	with	a	toddler	is	through	facial	expressions,	tone,	and	words.	At	some point	 in	 the	 potty	 training	 process,	 you	 have	 to	 establish	 that	 peeing	 on	 the floor	is	bad	and	peeing	in	the	potty	is	good.	You	must	communicate	this	to	your child.	How	you	choose	to	do	it	is	your	parenting	call.	If	you	are	using	the	same exact	expression,	tone,	and	words	for	pees	that	do	and	do	not	make	it	into	the potty,	your	child	is	going	to	assume	that	both	are	acceptable.

Think	 of	 it	 this	 way:	 when	 your	 child	 hits	 another	 kid,	 you	 employ expression,	tone,	and	words	to	communicate	that	his	action	was	wrong.	You	say, 'No.	We	don't	hit.'	You	physically	intervene	and	stop	the	hitting.	You	most likely	 will	 have	 a	 frown	 or	 a	 facial	 expression	 that	 communicates	 displeasure. Same	thing	with	potty	training;	you	don't	have	to	be	mean	about	it,	but	do	be clear.	There's	a	right	way	and	a	wrong	way.	You	want	to	teach	your	child	the right	way.

## They	Get	It,	They	Lose	It,	They	Get	It,	They	Lose	It

This	situation	is	very	similar	to	the	'it's	not	okay'	scenario.	Once	your	child	has had	a	couple	of	successes	in	a	row,	you	know	he	can	do	it.	The	learning	process is	over.	Yes,	there	can	still	be	accidents,	but	there	will	generally	be	some	clear reason	 for	 them.	 If	 there	 isn't,	 head	 over	 to	 chapter	 13,	 'Behavior	 vs.	 Potty Training'	 and	 give	 the	 ideas	 presented	 there	 some	 thought.	 Once	 your	 child starts	 to	 use	 the	 potty	 correctly,	 you	 know	 he can .	 From	 there,	 unexplained backsliding	 is	 usually	 a	 behavioral	 issue,	 either	 the	 result	 of	 resistance	 or 'laziness.'

## Pooping	in	Nap/Night	Diaper

So	 you're	 a	 couple	 of	 weeks	 into	 potty	 training,	 and	 it's	 coming	 to	 your attention	that	your	child	is	saving	his	poop	for	the	nap	or	nighttime	diaper.	It might	appear	that	she	is	specifically	 holding	 it	 for	 her	 diaper,	 or	 it	 could	 just look	 like	 she	 has	 readjusted	 her	 timing.	 For	 most	 children,	 this	 really	 does straighten	out	on	its	own.	If	you	are	in	no	way	ready	to	tackle	night	training,	it's okay	to	let	this	ride	out	for	a	bit.	For	most	children,	it's	simply	about	relaxing. When	potty	 training	 is	 so	 new,	 they	 are	 only	 fully	 relaxed	 at	 nighttime.	 As daytime	gets	better	and	better,	they	will	start	pooping	on	the	potty	in	waking hours.	However,	if	you	do	feel	up	to	night	training,	the	fix	is	to	ditch	the	diapers all	together.	This	isn't	actually	a	difficult	fix,	because	most	people	don't	get	up in	the	middle	of	the	night	to	poop.	So	you've	got	nature	on	your	side.	Head	over to	chapter	6,	'Nighttime	Training,'	and	start	that	soon.	I	highly	recommend	a couple	of	nights	of	 bare	 bummed-not	just	commando.	This	is	because	when your	child	is	sleeping,	she	needs	strong,	unconscious	reminders	to	either	get	up or	 hold	 it	 (in	 addition	 to	 the	 two	 wake	 ups	 recommended	 in	 the	 chapter). Here's	 the	 thing:	 underpants	 or	 commando	 pjs	 will	 help	 to	 contain	 any accident,	but	they	can,	in	fact,	actually cause the	accident	(because	fabric	on	the bum	can	feel	like	a	diaper	and	trigger	muscle	memory).	It's	a	catch-22,	and	what you	decide	to	do	is	your	call.	Regardless,	I'd	set	down	some	Chux	(aka	piddle pads)	 or	 a	 towel	 under	 your	 child	 for	 nighttime.	 The	 diaper-pooping	 issue usually	takes	one	or	two	nights	to	straighten	out,	so	it's	not	like	it's	going	to	go on	 forever	 once	 you	 take	 the	 diapers	 off.	 Also,	 giving	 up	 diapers	 all	 together usually	helps	clean	up	any	other	little	potty	training	issues	you	may	be	dealing with.

## Revenge	Pee

Say	your	child	has	done	something	wrong	and	you've	put	her	in	the	time-out chair.	Once	there,	she	has	an	accident	(but	whether	it	was	really	an	'accident' is	unclear).	If	she's	in	hysterics,	chances	are	the	pee	came	with	the	emotion.	You might	want	to	attempt	to	get	a	pee	before	the	actual	time-out	(I	wish	you	luck with	that).	If	you	get	the	distinct	feeling	that	the	'accident'	was	more	of	an	'eff you,'	you	can	do	a	couple	of	things.	One,	wait	until	the	end	of	the	time-out	and then	 clean	 it	 up.	 I	 am	 not	 a	 fan	 of	 making	 a	 child	 'sit	 in	 it,'	 and	 I	 never recommend	it.	However,	at	this	age,	a	time-out	shouldn't	be	more	than	one	or two	minutes	in	any	event,	so	it's	not	a	big	deal.	You	have	to	have	some	leverage here;	you	can't	rush	to	get	her	out	of	time-out	just	because	she	pees.	If	you	do, you	 will	 have	 accomplished	 nothing	 other	 than	 to	 teach	 her	 that	 if	 she	 pees herself,	she	will	get	out	of	the	discipline.	I	do	advise	considering	consequences other	than	time-outs	while	potty	training.	To	be	clear,	this	is	all	assuming	that the	original	'crime'	is	something	like,	say,	hitting-not	potty	training	related.	If you	think	you	are	experiencing	bad	behavior	related	to	potty	training,	head	over to	chapter	13,	'Behavior	vs.	Potty	Training.'

## 'The	Inner	'F**k	It'	'

If	you	have	been	going	at	potty	training	for	a	few	weeks	and	you	are	still	getting one	or	more	accidents	a	day	on	a	consistent	basis,	it's	time	to	go	back	and	do Block	One	over	again.	A	child	having	that	many	accidents	doesn't	really	count as	 being	 potty	 trained.	 What	 most	 likely	 happened	 is	 that	 something	 went wrong	somewhere	along	the	way,	and	your	child	has	a	gap	in	his	understanding. You	don't	have	to	go	through	the	whole	process	again,	but	be	sure	to	cover	the basics.	The	problem	is	this:	if	a	child	has	a	gap	in	his	learning	or	understanding, he	will	quickly	transition	his	attitude	into	what	I	call	'the	inner	'f**k	it.'	'	This is	the	'I	don't	care'	attitude	that	comes	from	being	stuck	and	not	knowing	how to	get	out	of	it.	Think	of	the	punk	in	high	school	who	talked	back	and	skipped classes.	 Nine	 times	 out	 of	 ten	 that	 kid	 had	 a	 learning	 disorder	 or	 other circumstances	that	interfered	with	his	ability	to	succeed.	The	attitude	was	just	a front.	The	same	thing	can	happen	with	potty	training.	We	humans	like	to	be good	at	what	we	attempt.	When	we	can't	do	something	well,	we	tend	to	pretend we	 don't	 care	 about	 it.	 Of	 course,	 this	 isn't	 a	 logical	 or	 conscious	 thought process,	but	it's	what's	going	on.	Go	back	and	breeze	through	Blocks	One,	Two, and	 Three	 with	 your	 child,	 and	 figure	 out	 where	 the	 gap	 in	 learning	 is.	 (I'm betting	it's	between	being	naked	and	wearing	clothes.)

So,	those	are	most	of	the	major	snafus	that	can	arise	in	your	first	month	of potty	training.	There's	still	a	lot	more	information	yet	to	come	in	this	book,	in addition	 to	 some	 really	 random	 questions	 (and	 their	 answers)	 in	 chapter	 19, cleverly	titled	'Random	Tips	and	Questions.'

## CHAPTER	10

A ll	 we	 have	 done	 as	 mothers,	 fathers,	 and	 humans-graduate	 school,	 careers, global	travel,	making	art,	making	life-all	culminate	in	us	being	brought	to	our knees	because	our	child	did	or	did	not	poop	in	the	potty.	Had	someone	told	you five	years	ago	that	you'd	be	here	now,	you'd	probably	have	laughed	out	loud.	But here	 it	 is.	 Poop.	 The	 begging.	 The	 cajoling.	 The	 eagle	 eye	 for	 signals.	 If	 you have	cried	over	poop,	this	chapter	is	for	you.

You	are	not	the	first,	 nor	 will	 you	 be	 the	 last,	 to	 have	 poop	 on	 the	 brain. Poop	is	an	endless	topic	in	potty	training-everything	from	slight,	unconscious withholding,	 to	 willful	 pooping	 on	 the	 floor,	 to	 massive	 power	 struggles	 over requesting	a	diaper	in	which	to	poop.	So	poop	makes	up	an	entire	chapter	of this	book,	and	in	it,	we're	going	to	delve	into	a	lot	of	things:	society,	philosophy, mythology	 and,	 yes,	 actual	 crap.	 To	 make	 sense	 of	 poop,	 you	 need	 to	 think about	 your	 child's	 perspective	 and	 see	 this	 through	 his	 eyes.	 There	 are	 a	 few things	to	keep	in	mind.

First,	all	your	child	has	ever	known	is	the	feeling	of	poop	right	up	against	his body.	Second,	as	he	sees	it,	no	one	has	ever	paid	much	attention	to	this	very primal,	very	private	function	before	today.	Third,	pooping	while	standing	up	or squatting	 is	 far	 more	 natural	 than	 pooping	 while	 sitting.	 Fourth,	 going	 from pooping	in	a	diaper	to	pooping	in	a	potty	can	be	freaky	as	hell.	Your	patience	is required.	Your	child	has	no	notion	yet	of	the	beauty	of	a	clean	bum.	It's	okay; he'll	get	there.

Think	about	your	poop.	You	know	those	gigunda	poops?	The	ones	that	make you	feel	like	you	lost	five	pounds	in	one	sitting?	Personally	I	love	those	poops, but	imagine	how	they	feel	to	a	small	child.	Shoot,	it	must	feel	like	all	her	insides are	falling	out.	Poops	can	be	scary.	To	make	them	a	little	less	so,	I	encourage parents	to	let	their	children	empty	their	own	small	pot	into	the	big	toilet.	When you	do	this,	you're	going	to	crack	up	(or	be	really	grossed	out);	almost	all	kids are	 fascinated	 by	 their	 poop.	 They	 will	 carry	 that	 pot	 to	 the	 big	 toilet	 staring and	smelling	and	checking	out	everything	about	that	poop,	mostly	with	a	ton	of pride:	'I	did	THAT?	THAT	came	outta	MY	butt?	Cooool.'

The	 number	 one	 problem	 with	 potty	 training	 and	 poop	 is	 that	 kids	 start holding	it	in.	The	other	big	problem	is	that	they	let	it	out	at	the	wrong	time. Unfortunately,	the	more	the	child	holds	it	in,	the	more	likely	it	is	to	come	out at	the	wrong	time.	Yeah?

So	let's	take	a	minute	to	dissect	the	modern	poop	situation.	I'm	here	to	tell you	that	pooping	has	gotten	more	problematic	over	the	past	several	decades.	If your	mom	wants	to	tell	you	about	how	easy	it	was	for	her	to	get	you	to	poop	on the	potty,	fine.	That	was	then,	this	is	now.	We	are	living	in	a	different	world, and	 we	 are	 different	 parents,	 yes?	 I've	 been	 potty	 training	 kids	 since	 2002.	 I wrote	the	first	edition	of	this	book	in	2009	and	started	helping	massive	numbers of	people	in	2011.	Pooping	has	become	more	of	a	problem	lately.	I	know	this.

Also,	 I'm	 fascinated	 with	 why,	 in	 one	 generation,	 things	 have	 changed	 so drastically.	 With	 why	 pooping	 is	 not	 only	 such	 a	 big	 ordeal,	 but	 is	 in	 fact becoming	 even	 more	 troublesome	 with	 each	 passing	 year.	 So	 I've	 spent	 an inordinate	amount	of	time	dissecting	the	poop	problem.	I	will	be	sharing	only the	highlights	because,	seriously	.	.	. no	one wants	to	hear	everything	I	have	to say	about	poops.

## Sir	Thomas	Crapper

This	guy	is	credited	with	inventing	the	flushing	toilet	in	the	1800s.	Actually,	he was	a	plumber	and	eventually	bought	the	patent.	The	real	inventor	was	Sir	John Harrington,	who	invented	his	first	toilet	was	in	1596.	Still,	that's	pretty	useless information,	and	I'm	sticking	with	Sir	Crapper	as	the	dude	who	invented	the potty.	It	just	sounds	better.	Anyway,	the	toilet	has	been	around	for	a	pretty	long while.	Now,	I've	traveled	the	globe	and	have	been	in	countries	where	squatting and	squat	toilets	are	the	norm.	Let	me	tell	you:	squatting	is	a	better	way	to	poop. It	 turns	 out	 there's	 a	 reason	 for	 this.	 The	 anorectal	 angle	 (the	 angle	 of	 the tunnel	that	carries	your	poop	to	your	anus)	gets	kinked	up	upon	sitting.	When you're	squatting	or	standing,	though,	there's	no	kinking.	This	makes	evacuation more	than	easy;	it's	almost	effortless.

I	believe	the	fact	that	we	(culturally)	sit	to	poop	is	part	of	the	problem	with kids	and	pooping.	We	adults	have	grown	very	used	to	it	and	can	deal	with	it,	but for	kids,	the	transition	from	squatting	or	standing	to	poop	(which	they	often	do when	wearing	a	diaper)	to	sitting	is	highlighted	during	potty	training.	By	itself, though,	 this	 doesn't	 fully	 explain	 the	 Big	 Poop	 Problem.	 Some	 kids	 have	 no trouble	sitting	 and	 pooping	 and,	 let's	 face	 it,	 the	 toilet	 has	 been	 around	 for	 a long	time.	If	the	sitting	position	were	the	sole	cause	of	pooping	problems,	we would've	ditched	the	toilet	long	before	now.

Still,	 sitting	 contributes	 to	 poop	 trouble,	 so	 until	 the	 perfect	 potty	 chair	 is designed-I'm	working	on	it-when	your	child	sits	to	poop,	you	can	put	some books	 underneath	 her	 feet	 to	 bring	 her	 thighs	 close	 to	 her	 chest.	 This	 helps create	 proper	 anorectal	 alignment,	 and	 makes	 pooping	 infinitely	 easier.	 I personally	use	a	Squatty	Potty.	You	might	consider	this	for	yourself	and	for	your child	as	she	gets	bigger;	my	six-year-old	son loves it.

In	short,	the	proper	poop	position	is	important,	but	it	can't	be	the	sole	reason for	pooping	problems.

## Pooping	Is	Primal

Pooping	itself	is	a	very	primal	function.	Our	poop	is	a	piece	of	us-literallyand	releasing	it	requires	privacy	which,	if	you	think	about	it,	a	diaper	affords. When	a	child's	bum	is	covered,	it	feels	concealed	and	private.	It's	keeping	the bum	out	in	the	air,	which	we	do	when	we	potty	train,	that	makes	pooping	feel public	 and	 uncomfortable	 at	 first.	 As	 adults,	 we	 usually	 go	 in	 a	 small	 room dedicated	 to	 pooping	 and	 close	 the	 door.	 We	 don't	 take	 kindly	 to	 intruders, either.	Our	children	have	those	same	desires.	If	your	child	resists	pooping,	the very	 first	 thing	 you	 should	 offer	 is	 privacy.	 The	 level	 of	 privacy	 you	 can	 give depends	on	the	age	of	the	child.	Age	also	tends	to	determine	how	much	privacy your	child	needs.	Kids	under	the	age	of	twenty-four	months	generally	need	less. From	twenty-four	months	on,	each	passing	month	will	bring	your	child	more self-awareness.	More	awareness	usually	means	they	need	more	privacy.	Offering your	child	privacy	can	be	as	simple	as	'forgetting'	something	in	the	other	room once	 your	 child	 is	 situated	 on	 the	 potty.	 Alternately,	 you	 can	 close	 the bathroom	door.

Simply	 put,	 too	 often,	 especially	 during	 potty	 training,	 there's	 a	 glaring spotlight	on	a	very	personal	function.	But	again,	that's	just	one	little	piece	of the	pooping	puzzle.

## Your	Poop	Values

What	the	heck	are	poop	values,	right?	This	is	a	term	I	made	up	to	describe	your family's	view	on	poop.	Do	you	like	poop?	Is	pooping	a	joke	in	your	house?	(It's better	 if	 it	 is.)	 When	 someone	 goes	 into	 the	 bathroom	 and	 leaves	 a	 big	 stink behind,	 do	 you	 talk	 about	 the	 elephant	 in	 the	 room,	 or	 do	 you	 just	 not	 say anything?	 Are	 your	 the	 sort	 of	 family	 who,	 when	 someone	 farts,	 everyone pretends	 it	 didn't	 happen?	 Are	 you	 the	 kind	 of	 person	 who	 can	 only	 poop	 at home?	Simply	put,	are	you	embarrassed	by	poop,	or	is	it	just	one	of	those	things?

In	general,	we	are	a	culture	that	disdains	poop.	Attitudes	aside,	though,	it's	a vital	 bodily	 function	 that	 allows	 us	 to	 eliminate	 the	 waste	 products	 of	 our digestion.	To	quote	John	Robbins,	'You	aren't	what	you	eat.	You	are	what	you don't	shit.'

Your	poop	values	are	going	to	be	passed	on	to	your	child,	period.	If	you	don't like	poop,	your	child	won't	either.	If	you	think	it's	the	most	disgusting	thing	in the	world,	so	will	your	child.	If	you	can	poop	only	at	home,	chances	are,	your kid	will	be	the	same	way.

None	of	that	is	intended	as	judgment.	It's	just	fact.	Some	parents	are	weird about	poop,	but	they	expect	their	child	to	poop	on	a	potty	sitting	in	the	middle of	the	living	room.	Yeah.	No.

Now,	 maybe	 you	 think	 you're	 chill	 about	 poop.	 That's	 cool.	 But	 are	 you really?	 A	 good	 sign	 of	 your	 true	 'chillness'	 is	 your	 response	 to	 the	 suggestion that	your	child	be	in	the	bathroom	with	you	while	you	poop.	If	you're	fine	with that	 (or	 if	 that's	 how	 it	 already	 goes	 down	 in	 your	 house),	 great.	 If	 you	 are opposed	to	the	idea,	ask	yourself	why.	It's	probably	a	good	indication	that	you're not	as	chill	about	poop	as	you	think	you	are.

I	 suggest	 that	 before	 beginning	potty	training,	you	make	it	a	point	to	have your	child	in	the	bathroom	with	you	while	you	poop.	This	is	the	best	way	to model	the	potty	behavior	you're	going	to	be	teaching.	Your	child	can	see	that pooping	might	sometimes	take	several	minutes.	That	people	sometimes	grunt	or make	facial	expressions.	And	they	see	that	poop	falls	out	of	you,	into	the	toilet, and	nobody	dies	because	of	it.	These	are	all	very	valid	reasons	to	have	your	child see	you	poop.	You	don't	have	to	have	them	with	you	every	time.	In	fact,	it's	just as	valuable	to	once	in	a	while	announce	that	you	have	to	go	poop	and	you'd	like some	privacy.	This	is	a	good	way	to	introduce	this	word	and	notion.

## Diet

Of	course,	we	can't	look	at	pooping	problems	without	talking	about	diet.	Most kids	have	a	pretty	clean	diet	when	they're	young	(generally	speaking,	I'll	say	up to	 about	 twenty-four	 months).	 Most	 moms	 focus	 on	 fruits,	 veggies,	 and	 other good	stuff.	Most	moms	allow	the	occasional	treat	or	juice	box.	After	their	child turns	two,	though,	I	find	that	most	parents	start	'caving	in'	a	little	more.	The number	 of	 birthday	 party	 invitations	 increases	 and,	 along	 with	 them,	 cake consumption	 increases.	 Parents	 start	 allowing	 a	 little	 more	 candy	 or	 juice	 or whatever	the	case	may	be.	It	is,	in	general,	something	we	all	start	to	relent	on	a little	bit	more.

Two	years	of	age	is	also	around	the	time	that	toddlers	can	start	to	get	picky. They	 start	 showing	 food	 preferences,	 and	 it's	 usually	 crappy	 food	 they	 prefer. This	is	the	age	when	the	'won't	eat	anything	but	macaroni	and	cheese'	phase begins.	 This	 is	 also	 the	 age	 of	 the	 on-the-go	 food.	 Your	 child	 has	 probably mastered	eating	without	you	watching	every	bite	to	make	sure	he	doesn't	choke, right? So	 you're	 more	 comfortable	 giving	 snacks	 in	 the	 car	 and	 at	 the playground.	These	snacks	are	generally	easy	to	grab	and	not	horribly	messy,	like crackers	and	dry	cereal.

Now,	I	know	this	isn't	a	nutrition	book,	but	I'd	be	remiss	if	I	didn't	include	a bit	about	food	allergies	here	in	the	poop	section.

One	in	three	of	my	clients	with	children	with	poop	problems	end	up	with	a food	 allergy	 diagnosis.	 Gluten	 is	 the	 major	 offender,	 with	 dairy	 being	 a	 close second. If	your	child	is	either	often	constipated	or	has	loose	stools ,	please,	do	yourself a	huge	favor	and	see	an	allergist. If	your	child	is	pooping	loose	stools	more	than	four times	 a	 day	 .	 .	 . something	 is	 not	 right.	 More	 important,	 your	 child	 is	 not digesting	their	food,	which	can	lead	to	malnutrition.

I	know	food	allergies	are	a major pain	in	the	butt.	I	know	this.	But	I	can't	tell you	the	number	of	parents	who	realize	a	food	culprit,	fix	it,	and	miraculously their	child's	poop	problem	is	gone.

And	now	a	few	words	about	fat.	The	low-fat	craze	is	no	good,	especially	for young	 children.	 Be	 sure	 your	 child	 is	 getting	 adequate,	 healthy	 fats.	 Good sources	in	my	opinion	are	coconut	oil,	avocado,	olive	oil,	seed	and	nut	butters, high-quality	 butter,	 and	 full-fat	 plain	 yogurt.	 Adequate	 fat	 will	 not	 only	 help with	pooping,	but	it	seems	to	me	that	it	improves	a	child's	ability	to	focus	and behave.

Personally,	 I	 eat	 according	 to	 the	 paleo,	 primal,	 or	 caveman	 diet,	 and	 I've never	 experienced	 such	 health	 as	 I	 do	 now.	 I	 don't	 eat	 grains	 and	 don't	 feed them	to	my	son.	When	I	switched	his	way	of	eating,	he	became,	I	swear	to	God, nearly	angelic	in	behavior.	He	also	is	much	more	focused	throughout	the	day and	is	not	constantly	hungry.	His	bleeding	eczema	is	gone.	Again,	this	isn't	a nutrition	book,	so	I'll	leave	it	at	that.

If	your	child	is	having	a	hard	time	with	pooping,	you	may	be	tempted	to	up his	fiber	level.	That's	fine,	but	not	all	dried	fruits	(a	common	go-to	for	increased dietary	fiber)	are	actually	high	in	fiber,	and	some	can	have	the	opposite	effect and	 clog	 things	 up	 (they	 also	 stick	 to	 tiny	 molars).	 Personally,	 I've	 found coconut	in	any	form-be	it	oil,	flakes,	or	milk-to	be	the best for	loosening	up poops.	You	can	make	recipes	with	coconut,	but	honestly,	just	a	teaspoon	or	two of	 the	 milk	 or	 oil	 will	 move	 things	 along	 very	 nicely.	 Ground	 flax	 seed	 with coconut	 milk	 makes	 an	 amazing	 hot	 breakfast	 cereal	 and	 really,	 really	 helps pooping.	Regardless,	from	my	experience,	I	recommend	increasing	your	child's fat consumption	 before	 upping	 their	 fiber.	 Seriously.	 It	 makes	 that	 big	 a difference.

All	 this	 aside,	 even	 diet	 doesn't	 completely	 solve	 the	 pooping	 puzzle.	 The right	diet	certainly	will	help	things	but	it's	not	the	complete	answer.	After	all, it's	 not	like	the	day	you	start	potty	training	your	child	completely	changes	his eating,	 right?	 And	 still,	 many	 parents	 with	 a	 child	 who	 pooped	 three	 times	 a day,	no	problem,	with	a	diaper	on,	see	drama	start	when	the	diaper	comes	off.	So the	trouble's	got	to	be	in	the	potty	training.

Here's	 where	 things	 get	 interesting.	 I've	 looked	 at	 the	 poop	 problem	 from	 all angles,	 trust	 me.	 For	 generations	 upon	 generations,	 pooping	 has	 generally	 not been	a	problem.	Suddenly,	the	last	ten	years	are	bringing	about	increasing	poop problems.	Diet	is	a	factor.	Squatting	versus	sitting	is	a	factor.	Still,	there's	one factor	we	haven't	looked	at,	and	in	my	opinion,	it's	the	big	one:	the	speed	at which	 our	 world	 moves.	 These	 days,	 we	 get	 information	 and	 connect	 with others	so	much	faster	than	previous	generations	ever	did.	I	think	the	world	is moving	too	damn	fast	for	our	kids.	 I	 think	 that	 as	 a	 result,	 they	 are	 anxious, regardless	of	how	we	try	individually	to	combat	this	at	home.

If	we	think	of	your	child	as	fundamentally	anxious,	and	of	the	diaper	as	your child's	 oldest	 and	 dearest	 security	 blanket,	 the	 poop	 problem	 makes	 sense.	 In essence,	 I	 don't	 think	 it's	 the	 pooping itself that	 is	 the	 problem.	 I	 think	 our children	 are	 clinging	 to	 the	 literal	 security	 blanket	 of	 something	 (the	 diaper) that	they've	known	since	birth.	Lately,	I've	seen	more	and	more	kids	literally asking	for	a	diaper	to	poop	in,	as	opposed	to	using	the	potty.	Ten	years	ago,	this was	nearly	unheard	of,	but	now	it's	becoming	increasingly	common.

Let's	 go	 further	 and	 examine	 the	 psychology	 of	 withholding	 (not	 pooping) and	 its	 opposite,	 which	 is	 letting	 go	 (pooping).	 As	 far	 back	 as	 mythology, withholding	versus	letting	go	is	a	very	common	theme.	Even	today,	that	theme drives	a	lot	of	movie	plots.	So	if	pooping	is	the	Grand	Pooh-Bah	of	letting	go, why	would	a	child	withhold?

I	 think	 this	 is	 a	 very	 interesting	 question	 and	 worth	 examining.	 We,	 as	 a society,	 are	 on	 edge.	 Our	 politics	 are	 damn	 near	 a	 reality	 show.	 Our	 reality shows	 feed	 popular	 culture	 and	 promote	 wildly	 bad	 behavior.	 Facebook	 has become	 a	 very	 real	 addiction.	 Online	 news,	 the	 ability	 to	 Like	 and	 Share, blogs	.	.	.	all	these	things	combine	to	make	for	a	fast-paced	world.	We	as	moms, in particular, are subject to an	 onslaught	 of not only frightening news (kidnappings,	 etc.)	 but	 also	 parenting	 media	 drama,	 like	 the	 infamous Time magazine	and	the	breast-feeding	cover.	All	this	media	just	serves	to	confuse	us and	wound	our	intuition.	It	also	makes	us	feel	anxious,	which	our	children	pick up	on.

But	 media	 isn't	 the	 only	 factor.	 Children	 are	 now	 a	 market,	 more	 so	 than ever	before.	That	is	another	big	difference	I	see	in	comparing	a	generation	ago and	now.	Birthday	parties	are	big	events,	and	kids	get	invited	to	a	lot	of	them.	I met	a	mom	who	couldn't	find	a	good	weekend	to	start	potty	training	her	twoyear-old;	six	weekends	in	a	row	were	packed	with	back-to-back	birthday	parties. That's	too	much.

Many,	many	parents	have	written	me	to	ask	if	their	 child	 can	 go	 to	 swim class	or	toddler	gym	or	music	class	on	the	second	day	of	potty	training.	Working potty	training	into	your	toddler's	schedule	is	doing	things	in	reverse	order.	Potty training	is	a	vital	life	skill;	your	child	needs	to	learn	how	to	put	poop	in	a	potty more	than	he	needs	to	attend	a	music	class.	But	that's	neither	here	nor	there. The	 point is, kids these days have	 busy schedules. We	 all know	 that overscheduling	is	not	good,	and	we	may	not	think	of	our	toddlers	as	being	truly overscheduled,	but	for	toddlers,	just	about	anything	can	count	as	a	big	event.	I think	our	children	are	running	on	fumes	most	of	the	time	and	have	what	I	call 'emotional	hangovers.'

There's	also	the	fact	that	parents	are	highly	invested	in	'making	memories.' In	my	opinion,	memories	get	made	in	the	small,	lovely	moments	that	take	place between	you	and	your	child.	They	don't	necessarily	require	Disneyland	or	the latest	Wiggles	concert.

Bottom	line:	we	are	moving	too	fast.	We	are	exposing	our	children	to	too much,	too	soon.	It's	become	part	of	our	society.	Case	in	point,	I	took	my	son	to the	movies	to	see Chimpanzee ,	a	great	nature	film.	He	gets	to	watch	TV	and	go to	 the	 movies,	 but	 I'm	 picky	 about	 what	 he	 watches.	 The	 previews	 for	 other movies	at	this	particular	movie	nearly	gave	us	both	seizures;	the	speed	at	which images	were	thrown	at	us	was	assaulting.	These	days,	though,	this	experience	is typical.	Everything	around	us	moves	at	a	very	rapid	pace.	We	can	barely	stand boredom;	the	minute	we	or	our	children	might	be	bored,	we	rush	to	fill	the	void.

Now,	I	live	in	the	real	world,	and	I	love	Facebook	and	my	smart	phone,	so I'm	not	suggesting	you	give	up	all	media,	but	I	am	asking	you	to	slow	down.	Try to	combat	the	overt	marketing	to	our	children	at	home.	Take	time	to	revel	in their	milestones,	like	potty	training,	zippering	up	zippers,	tying	shoes,	and	riding bikes.	Children	love	routine.	Children	need	time	to	discover	the	world	around them.	Downtime	is	not	only	good,	it's	essential.	Boredom	begets	creativity;	it's good	for	the	soul.

To	return	to	our	discussion	of	poop,	I	think	our	fast-paced	world	is	largely responsible	for	poop	problems	and	why	they're	so	common.	I	hear	from	so	many moms,	'I've	been	home	with	my	kid	for	two	whole	days	potty	training.	I'm	going out	of	my	mind.'	No	offense,	but	spending	two	days	at	home	shouldn't	make you	go	crazy.	Just	something	to	think	about.

Be	sure	you	are	creating	a	safe	haven	for	your	child,	so	she	has	room	to	slow down	 and	 explore	 at	 her	 own	 pace.	 We	 have	 it	 all	 backward	 today.	 We	 are overstimulating	and	overscheduling	in	one	breath,	and	yet	in	the	next,	we	are delaying	life	skill	milestones	(like	potty	training).

My	son's	preschool	was	fantastic.	They	were	very	Montessori/Waldorf-y	but had	no	official	affiliation	with	either.	They	baked	their	own	snacks	every	day and	 sat	 family-style.	 They	 poured	 their	 own	 water	 and	 measured	 stuff.	 No characters	 were	 allowed,	 to	 discourage	 marketing	 to	 children,	 no	 sugar	 was allowed	in	their	lunch	boxes-that	kind	of	school.	One	of	the	reasons	I	choose this	 school	 was	 because	 there	 was	 no	 play	 yard.	 The	 school	 was	 located downtown,	and	the	kids	utilized	 the	 entire	 city	 around	 them.	 They	 went	 out every	 single	 day	 of	 the	 year-except	 for	 one	 very	 blizzard-y	 day-cold,	 rain, shine,	or	snow.	I	highly	valued	that.

They	 also	 taught	 the	 kids	 how	 to	 dress	 themselves	 completely	 for	 the weather.	How	to	get	on	snow	pants	and	mittens	and	boots.	How	to	zipper	and button	and	tie.	It	was	fantastic!!	This	teaching	of	life	skills	was	so	much	more valuable	 than	 any	 other	 sort	 of	 'teaching'	 they	 could	 have	 done.	 Let	 me	 tell you:	we	live	in	New	England,	and	having	a	three-year-old	who	can	get	his	own winter	clothes	on	is	truly	an	amazing	thing.	I	bring	this	up	because	to	me,	that's the	right	order	of	things.	My	child's	brain	didn't	need	specific	stimulation	for math	or	reading	or	music.	My	child	needed	to	be	in	control	of	his	own	person. Learning	life	skills	like	how	to	use	the	potty	lets	that	happen.	It	builds	inherent self-pride	in	mastery.	That's	where	self-esteem	grows.

All	this	chatter	about	why	pooping	has	gotten	harder	is	all	well	and	good,	but you're	here	because	you	want	to	know	what	to	do	about	it,	so	let's	look	at	the most	common	scenarios	and	some	superspecial	ones,	too.

As	we	do	so,	something	to	keep	in	mind	above	all	else:	this	is all	 new .	 The feeling	 of	 warm,	 squishy	 poop	 next	 to	 your	 child's	 bum	 is	 the	 norm.	 A	 freefalling	 poop	 into	 'a	 pit'	 of	 sorts	 can	 be	 scary.	 It's	 our	 social	 norm	 to	 put	 our poop	in	a	container,	but	remember,	for	the	better	part	of	two	years,	your child's norm	has	been	the	diaper.

There	are	so	many	facets	to	why	pooping	is	so	dramatic	that	I've	broken	the topic	 down	 into	 digestible	 parts.	 Let's	 take	 a	 few	 minutes	 and	 talk	 about	 the many	things	that	are	going	on	during	your	basic	poop	in	the	potty.	First,	there	is the	slight,	unconscious	withholding.	This	is	a	huge	concern	for	a	lot	of	parents. It	 might	look	like	this:	your	child	used	to	poop	two	or	three	times	a	day	in	a diaper.	Now	you	officially	start	potty	training	and	.	.	.	no	poop.	There	may	be resistance	to	actually	sitting	on	the	potty.	Some	children	will	say	a	variation	of, 'my	bum	hurts.'	Or	she	may	say	nothing,	and	there's	just	no	poop.

The	trick	here	to	remember,	right	from	the	get-go,	is	that	poop	is	personal,	in a	 very	 primal	 way.	 I	 think	 we	 as	 adults	 understand	 that	 when	 it	 comes	 to ourselves,	but	somehow	we	forget	it	when	it	comes	to	kids.	Poop	is	one	of	the few	things	we	can	truly	call	our	own.	Here's	another	way	to	look	at	it:	it's	said that	the	mouth	and	teeth	are	highly	emotional,	which	is	why	so	many	people panic	at	a	trip	to	the	dentist.	It's	an	orifice.	It's	mine.	Don't	go	in	there.	Right? Well	that's	an	orifice	everyone	can	see,	for	gawd's	sake!	The	butt	hole	was	not meant	for	scrutiny.	And	yet,	here	we	are	all	up	in	our	kids'	business	and	what they	keep	up	there.	This	whole	process	was	kept	tucked	away	in	a	diaper-of course,	you	did	change	the	diaper,	but	you	had	no	part	in	how	the	poop	came out,	right?	You	had	no	idea	how	the	process	worked	for	your	kid.	You	probably saw	a	'poop	face,'	but	that's	just	when	it	got	pushed	out.	We	have	no	idea	how long	it	took	to	'park	itself	on	the	off	ramp.'	So	now	you	start	potty	training	and it's	 like	 this	 glaring	spotlight	has	now	been	put	on	your	kid's	butt	and	what	it produces.

Let's take	 another	 minute	 to	 talk	 about	 that	 glaring	 spotlight	 on	 an otherwise,	private	function.	The	anus	is	a	sphincter	muscle.	It	opens	and	closes with	emotion.	[This	is	one	of	my	favorite	lines	in	this	book-I'm	even	thinking of	getting	T-shirts	made.	Because	I	am	not	well.]

I'll	give	you	an	example	by	way	of	another	big	sphincter	muscle:	the	cervix. The	cervix	is	one	of	the	major	muscles	responsible	for	a	baby's	journey	out	into the	world.	Ina	May	Gaskin,	a	world-renowned	midwife,	explains	how	the	cervix needs	to	be	open	to	effectively	give	birth.	She	also	notes	that	it	can	slam	shut:

Even	when	the	voluntary	muscles	get	tired,	the	sphincters	don't	get	tired.	Those	are	connected	to the	organs	that	fill	up	with	something;	the	bladder,	uterus,	intestines.	They	expand	and	contract,	and when	they	yawn	open,	whatever	is	inside	comes	out,	and	then	they	close	again.	But,	they	work	better in	privacy;	they're	shy,	and	this	is	true	of	humans	and	most	animals.	We	seek	privacy	to	allow	our sphincters	to	do	their	jobs,	jobs	that	at	the	most	basic	level,	have	to	do	with	hormone	levels	in	the body.	For	example,	oxytocin	levels	in	blood	rise	when	something	big	comes	out	(whether	it's	a	baby or	 a	 bowel	 movement).	Laughter	is	one	thing	that	can	help	open	the	sphincters.	I	ask	women	to laugh	when	they're	having	a	baby	because	it	helps	the	process	along;	it	also	adds	to	oxytocin	and endorphin	 levels.	 But	 on	 the	 converse,	 if	 someone	 is	 afraid	 or	 feels	 violated,	 for	 example,	 the sphincter	can	slam	shut.

Now,	she	has	been	known	to	illustrate	this	 point	 in	 her	 birth	 classes.	 She puts	a	big	silver	bowl	in	the	middle	of	the	room,	with	a	hundred-dollar	bill	in	it. Anyone	who	can	poop	in	the	big	silver	bowl	can	have	the	hundred	dollars.	So far,	no	one's	been	able	to.

So,	 here	 we	 are	 potty	 training	 and	 the	 potty	 chair	 is	 pretty	 much	 in	 the middle of the room-even	 if	 only metaphorically speaking-right? The spotlight	is	on	the	potty	chair.	The	spotlight	is	on	the	child	and	the	poop.	We're expecting	the	child	to	poop	in	the	silver	bowl	.	.	.	and	it	doesn't	always	work that	 way.	 The	 tricky	 part	 is	 that	 you	 can't	 give	 your	 child	 complete	 privacy when	they	are	learning	something.	They	can't	be	left	alone	because	they	most likely	 need	 your	 help	 in	 recognizing	 the	 feeling	 of	 needing	 to	 poop	 and manipulating	the	actual	getting	to	and	on	the	potty	chair.

I	 generally	 find	 parents	 are	 not	 tolerant	 of	 any	 stalling	 on	 the	 child's	 part, when	 it	 comes	 to	 poop.	 The	 parents	 have	 decided	 to	 potty	 train	 and	 expect everything	to	just	flow	the	way	it	did	in	the	relative	privacy	of	the	diaper.	When things	 don't	 flow	 that	 smoothly,	 the	 parents	 confuse	 the	 delay	 with	 the	 child 'not	being	ready.'	In	fact,	the	complete	opposite	is	true:	the	earlier	you	potty train,	 the	 less	 your	 child	 is	 aware	 of	 the	 general	 need	 for	 privacy	 during	 this bodily	function.	The	older	child	will	be	very	aware	and	will	thus	show	increased resistance.

As	the	cervix	does,	the	anus	relaxes	in	an	environment	that	is	gentle.	An environment	 without	 a	 lot	 of	 fanfare	 and	 words.	 An	 environment	 that	 is relaxed,	 semiprivate,	 and	 perhaps	 filled	 with	 laughter.	 The	 more	 normal	 and routine	you	can	make	pooping	for	your	child,	the	more	relaxed	the	anus	is	going to	be.	The	glaring	spotlight	of	this	whole	process	can	back	some	kids	up	(not	to the	 point	 of	 true	 constipation,	 but	 to	 where	 they're	 not	 pooping	 the	 normal once	 or	 twice	 a	 day).	 That's	 totally	 normal.	 The	 analogy	 to	 labor	 carries through:	When	you	are	in	labor	you	want	someone	sure	and	steady	by	your	side. You	don't	want	someone	overtalking	logic	and	reason.	You	don't	want	someone high-strung.	And	you	certainly	don't	want	anyone	breathing	down	your	neck	to get	it	done.

Patience,	consistency,	and	understanding	are	what	will	make	this	normal	for your	 child.	 I	 realize	 providing	 privacy	 is	 hard	 with	 a	 small	 child	 who	 is	 just learning	 a	 new	 skill,	 but	 there	 are	 some	 ways	 you	 can	 help.	 In	 the	 very beginning	stages	of	potty	training,	I	suggest	you	keep	the	potty	chair	wherever your	 child	 spends	 the	 most	 time,	 but	 that	 doesn't	 mean	 it	 has	 to	 be	 in	 the middle	of	the	room.	The	pooping	process	can	be	discreet	without	being	behind closed	 doors.	 You	 can	 be	 by	 your	 child's	 side	 but	 not	 all	 up	 in	 his	 business (Seriously.	Do	not	spread	your	kid's	butt	cheeks	to	check	if	the	poop	is	coming. A	hard	urge	to	resist,	but	resist	you	must.)	A	really	great	trick	is	to	get	your	child sitting	for	a	poop	and	all	of	sudden	think	of	something	you	need	to	do	in	the other	room.	Tell	him	to	sit	tight,	you'll	be	right	back.	Nine	times	out	of	ten,	the child	will	poop	when	you	are	gone	for	a	minute.	In	fact,	a	huge	telltale	sign	that it's	time	to	potty	train	right	now	is	when	your	child	goes	somewhere	specifically to	poop.	Don't	miss	that	window	of	opportunity!

The	goal	is	to	take	that	glaring	spotlight	off	your	kid	and	off	this	process.	No one	 wants	 to	 poop	 with	 all	 eyes	 on	 them.	 Of	 course,	 a	 nice	 high	 five	 and	 a yahoo	once	the	deed	is	done	is	perfectly	fine!

If	your	child	isn't	pooping	in	those	first	few	days,	relax.	This	isn't	willful	and	it's not	manipulation:	it's	a	normal	process	of	wanting	to	keep	what's	theirs,	theirs.

Ina	May	Gaskin	ends	her	discussion	of	sphincter	muscles	with	this:	'	.	.	.	if someone	is	afraid	or	feels	violated,	the	sphincter	will	slam	shut.'	Of	course,	she's referring	to	the	cervix	and	birth,	and	I'm	referring	to	the	anus	and	poop.	Same difference.	A	sphincter	by	any	other	name	is	still	a	sphincter.

Now,	that	brings	us	to	the	next	logical	point.	Why	on	earth	would	a	child feel	afraid	or	violated	during	potty	training?	Well,	for	a	lot	of	reasons,	actually, none	 of	 which	 have	 to	 do	 with	 'readiness.'	 I	 already	 mentioned	 the	 privacy issue:	 putting	 a	 glaring	 spotlight	 on	 a	 private	 function	 can	 feel	 violating.	 Of course,	I'm	not	talking	about	the	kinds	of	horrible	violations	that	you	sometimes see	 on	 the	 news-I'm	 talking	 more	 the	 embarrassing	 kind	 of	 violation-but nonetheless,	 on	 a	 primal	 level,	 it	 can	 feel	 violating.	 The	 same	 kind	 of embarrassing	 feeling	 of	 violation	 that	 makes	 us	 not	 want	 to	 blow	 a	 bunch	 of farts	 when	we're	in	a	public	restroom	and	someone's	in	the	next	stall.	I	know you	know	what	I'm	talking	about.

Let's	look	at	why	a	child	might	be	afraid	of	pooping	on	the	potty.	For	starters, it's	 new.	 Toddlers	 are	 known	 routine	 lovers.	 Diapers	 have	 been	 their	 routine since	.	.	.	hmmm	.	.	.	about	two	hours	after	birth.	Think	about	that.	Your	child may	well	have	been	in	a	diaper	before	he	even	fed	for	the	first	time!	Wow.	It's pretty	crazy	when	you	look	at	it,	huh?	So	yeah,	something	this	big	and	new	is going	to	throw	him.	You	know	how	most	kids	go	through	a	period	of	separation anxiety	when	they're	apart	from	you?	Well,	they've	known	and	loved	a	diaper about	as	long	as	they've	known	and	loved	you.	So	it's	fair	to	say	the	fear	can	be equated	with	a	sort	of	separation	anxiety.

I	use	many	phrases	to	describe	what	a	diaper	might	mean	to	a	kid:	a	habit,	a routine,	an	addiction,	a	security	blanket.	Behind	the	words	is	the	same	notion: pooping	in	a	diaper	is	all	your	child	has	known.	Now,	you	and	I	logically	know about	waste	management,	the	toxicity	of	fecal	matter,	and	the	wonders	of	the sewer	system,	but	once	again,	let's	look	at	this	through	toddler	eyes:	since	the dawn	of	your	kid's	 time,	 he	 has	 pooped	 in	 a	 diaper.	 Maybe	 he	 knows	 you	 go elsewhere	to	do	your	business,	maybe	he	knows	you	don't	wear	a	diaper,	maybe he	knows	other	grown-ups	go	elsewhere	to	do	their	business.	But	probably	not. Because	 toddlers	 don't	 really	 give	 a	 crap	 about	 anyone	 but	 themselves,	 as witnessed	 by	 the	 never-ending	 required	 messaging	 'Please	 share.'	 This	 is	 all totally	normal	and,	I	think,	kind	of	cool.	Anyway,	all	this	is	by	way	of	saying: don't	expect	your	toddler	to	come	to	the	logical	conclusion	that	one	day,	he	too will	 be	 pooping	 in	 that	 same	 designated	 place.	 In	 fact,	 expecting	 anything logical	at	all	from	your	toddler	would	be	your	first	mistake.

Your	kid,	for	probably	around	two	years,	has	been	pooping	the	only	way	he knows	how,	and	then	one	day,	you	ask	him	to	poop	elsewhere.	Do	you	see	how this	could	be	met	with	resistance?	Imagine	if	you	came	to	visit	me	at	my	house, and	I	told	you	that	we	only	poop	in	the	corner	of	my	living	room.	I	tell	you	up, down,	 and	 sideways	 that	 it's	 okay.	 We	 all	 do	 it.	 Really.	 I'll	 give	 you	 privacy. Please,	please,	poop	in	the	corner	of	my	living	room.	Don't	worry!	I'll	clean	it up!	No	matter	what,	it	would	still	feel	wrong.	Am	I	right	or	am	I	right?	Because you	know	logically	that	it's	unsanitary,	and	you	have	long	been	conditioned	to poop	in	the	proper	place.

Ahhh	.	.	.	the	magic	words: conditioned	to	poop	in	the	proper	place .	How	do	you condition	a	small	human,	whose	logical	reasoning	is	not	developed?	Funny	you should	ask.	I'll	take	consistency	and	repetition	for	$1,000.	That	is	the	name	of the	pooping	game,	guys:	consistency	and	repetition.

Why	else	might	your	child	be	afraid	of	pooping	in	the	potty?	If	you	are	eating while	reading	this,	you	might	want	to	stop	for	a	bit.

Look,	all	your	child	has	known-in	addition	to	a	diaper-is	the	warm,	cozy feeling	of	her	poop	against	her	butt.	That	feeling	is	her	normal.	It's	her	safe,	her routine.	It	seems	pretty	gross	to	us	as	grown-ups,	but	it	feels	really	good	to	kids. Mostly,	because	it's	all	they	know.	I've	actually	worked	with	kids	who	can	say outright,	'I	like	the	warm	feeling	of	my	pee	and	poop	in	my	diaper.'	Good	thing they're	cute,	huh?

And	of	course,	let's	not	forget	the	fear	of	the	toilet	itself.	Over	the	years,	I've heard	of	every	manner	of	monsters	that	live	in	the	toilet.	It's	all	fun	and	games to	 flush	 until	 it's	 time	 to	 actually	 put	 their	 own	 tushies	 there.	 Again,	 looking through	the	kids'	eyes:	they	don't	understand	where	the	toilet	flushes	to	(dang logic).	And	then	we	ask	them	to	expose	a	very	personal,	vulnerable	part	of	their anatomy	 to	 this	 gaping	 chasm	 of	 God-knows-what.	 So	 yeah,	 it	 can	 be	 scary. Some	children	will	parlay	that	fear	right	over	to	the	little	potty,	but	most	kids get	a	real	kick	out	of	seeing	just	what	and	how	much	they	produced	(which	can be	 freakishly	 large)	 and	 dumping	 it	 in	 the	 toilet.	 This	 is	 why	 I	 always recommend	a	little	potty	chair;	I	think	they	are	brilliant.	The	little	pot	keeps the	poop	at	least	semiclose.	It's	a	literal	way	for	them	to	see	what	came	out	of them.	It	can	be	scary	to	give	up	what	feels	like	a	big	part	of	yourself	and	not have	it	close	by,	at	least	for	a	while.

The	little	potty	chair	is	tremendously	useful	in	getting	the	right	amount	of squat	to	properly	evacuate.	If	your	child	is	having	trouble	pooping	on	the	big toilet	insert,	you	should	try	the	little	potty	chair	with	books	under	his	feet.

All	in	all,	when	you	are	potty	training,	you're	redirecting	a	lifelong	habit.	It may	be	a	short	life	thus	far,	but	still,	a	lifelong	habit.	As	with	so	many	habits that	are	instilled	for	any	length	of	time,	it's	best	to	stop	the	habit	cold	turkey. Have	you	tried	to	get	a	kid	to	stop	sucking	on	a	binky?	What	works	is	throwing the	binky	out	and	dealing	with	the	fallout,	if	there	is	one.	Do	you	think	it	would effective	to	let	the	child	have	the	binky	for	an	hour	in	the	morning	but	no	other time?	Probably	not.	Toddlers	don't	think	logically.	They	don't	know	time.	Same thing	with	diapers.	Many	parents	take	the	fear	or	resistance	as	a	sign	that	the child	 is	 not	 ready;	 this	 is	 not	 true.	 In	 fact,	 the	 longer	 you	 keep	 your	 child	 in diapers,	the	longer	this	habit	gets	entrenched,	the	more	attached	the	child	is	to the	habit,	the	more	normal	the	warm	feeling	of	pee	and	poop	against	his	skin becomes.	It	becomes	harder	and	harder	with	passing	time	to	get	the	kid	to	give this	 up.	 The	 resistance	 and	 fear	 actually	 increase,	 which	 is	 what	 leads	 to	 epic power	struggles.

## Not	Getting	Any	Poop	at	All

This	problem	has	many	different	forms.	The	first	couple	of	days,	we	can't	really make	a	call.	As	I've	stated	many	other	places	in	this	book,	the	first	few	days	are learning.	We	can't	say	for	certain	what's	going	on	until	we	see	a	pattern	emerge. It's	very	common for	your	child	not	to	poop	on	the	first	or	second	day	of	potty training.	There's	a	lot	of	pressure,	even	from	the	most	chill	parents,	and	there's some	 performance	 anxiety.	 This	 natural	 pressure	 is	 why	 we	 want	 to	 keep everything	low-key	and	relaxed.	Within	this	broad	category	of	'no	poops'	there are	a	few	variations.

If	your	child	seems	be	doing	fine	with	peeing	and	attempting	to	sit	to	try	to poop,	don't	worry	at	all	about	the	poop.	It	will	come.

If	your	child	is	clearly	doing	a	poop	dance-you	know	they	have	to	go,	they know	they	have	to	go,	and	they	sit,	pop	up,	sit	pop	up,	walk	on	tiptoes,	and	the like-it's	okay.	Don't	try	to	rush	them.	I've	seen	this	dance	go	on	for	up	to	ten hours.	 Reassure	 them	 that	 poop	 goes	 in	 the	 potty.	 Always	 use	 words	 like	 'let go,'	'slide,'	'let	it	out,'	'drop'-think passive words.	For	kids,	poop	usually	does tend	 to	 slide	 out	 and,	 in	 fact,	 they	 are	 doing	 much	 more	 work	 by	 holding	 it. Remind	them	that	they	can	use	either	the	little	pot	or	the	toilet	insert.	Some kids	 have	 a	 clear	 preference.	 Offer	 to	 read	 to	 them	 or	 just	 sit	 with	 them. Remember	this	is	a	new	sensation.	It	can	be	freaky	because	it's new .	This	dance and	poop	troubles	never	have	anything	to	do	with	'readiness.'	Most	often,	the poop	will	come	in	due	time,	and	it	will	land	in	the	potty	or	toilet.

What	 if	 the	 poop	 dance	 has	 gone	 on	 and	 on	 and	 on	 and,	 of	 course,	 the minute	you	aren't	watching,	it	lands	on	the	floor?	This	is	okay	for	the	first	one or	two	poops.	Well,	it's	not	okay	actually,	but	it's	not	going	to	derail	the	process. Just	remind	your	child	that	it's	not	okay	to	poop	on	the	floor	and	that	poop	goes in	the	potty.	Validate	the	feelings.	'I	know	it	feels	very	strange,	and	you	must put	your	poop	in	the	potty.'	If	your	child	seems	weirded	out	by	the	poop,	you always	want	to	validate	that	feeling.	You	are	never,	ever	going	to	convince	her that	it	doesn't	feel	strange	or	at	the	very	least,	new.

If	the	poop	comes	the	minute	you	turn	your	back-usually	this	poop	is	also done	in	the	corner-this	is	great	news.	This	child	simply	needs	more	privacy.	As I've	mentioned	before,	you	can	get	him	situated	on	the	potty	and	the	'forget' something	in	the	other	room.	Nine	times	out	of	ten,	the	poop	will	come	when you	are	out	of	the	room.

I'll	 mention	 this	 again	 later	 on,	 but	 oftentimes	 when	 a	 kid	 is	 doing	 an elaborate	poop	dance	(walking	around	holding	her	butt,	usually	on	tippy	toes, and	it's	very	clear	they	have	to	go),	the	best	approach	is	actually	backing	off. You	can	just	throw	out	there,	'I	can	tell	you	have	to	poop.	There's	your	potty,	or you	 can	 use	 the	 big	 toilet.'	 This	 is	 a	 perfect	 time	 to	 be	 sure	 you	 are	 not overtalking.	You	need	to	give	her	some	room	to	make	a	good	decision.

If	 you	 have	 done	 all	 of	 this	 and	 you	 are	 consistently	 getting	 poops	 in	 the pants	or	the	floor,	it's	time	to	amp	things	up	a	bit.	One	thing	that	can	really help	is	actually	having	your	child	help	you	clean	up.	Obviously,	don't	let	your child	 handle	 the	 actual	 poop.	 But	 have	 him	 go	 get	 clean	 clothes	 and	 change himself.	Take	your	time	about	it.	The	idea	is	that	it	should	start	to	register	that it	takes	a	lot	more	time	out	of	play	to	clean	up	than	to	just	sit	and	do	it	on	the potty.	You	don't	want	to	let	your	child	dump	the	poop	and	flush	it	down.	That's the	part	of	the	process	that	is	usually	fun,	and	so	he	doesn't	get	to	do	that	unless he	sat	for	the	whole	deal.

The	 next	 thing	 you	 might	 need	 to	 do	 is	 provide	 a	 small,	 immediate consequence.	Some	parents	balk	at	this.	You	do	not	want	to	give	consequences in	 the	 first	 couple	 of	 days,	 when	 your	 child	 is	 still	 learning.	 But	 after	 you	 are pretty	certain	she	knows	the	ropes,	at	least	in	theory,	it's	okay	to	give	a	small consequence.	As	I	said,	it	should	be	small	and	immediate.	Usually	taking	away whatever	she	is	playing	with	at	the	time,	or	taking	her	out	of	that	activity,	does the	 trick.	 Time-outs	 are	 usually	 ineffective,	 as	 are	 longer-term,	 more	 distant consequences,	like	taking	away	dessert	after	dinner.	Little	kids	don't	have	the thought	process	to	connect	such	separate	events.

The	reason	you	want	to	give	a	consequence	is	that,	once	he	knows	the	drill and	is	still	pooping	in	his	pants	or	on	the	floor,	you're	dealing	with	a	behavior issue.	 Whether	 it's	 intentional	 rebelliousness	 or	 just	 being	 'lazy,'	 it's	 still behavior.	The	consequence	shouldn't	be	mean	or	draconian,	but	should	simply reinforce	cause-and-effect	in	a	way	that	actually	affects	him.	When	pooping	in his	pants	isn't	enough	of	an	effect	(and	for	some	children,	it	isn't)	we	need	to add	another	component.	You	can	also	refer	to	chapter	13,	'Behavior	vs.	Potty Training,'	for	more	on	this.

When	I	met	former	client	Rachel,	her	son	was	pretty	well	potty	trained.	He would	pee	on	his	own,	but	pooping	in	his	pants	was	a	recurring	issue.	Rachel really	balked	at	giving	a	consequence.	To	her,	it	felt	wrong	to	'punish'	her	son, Sean.	Upon	further	discussion	with	her,	it	became	clear	that	Sean	fell	into	the 'lazy'	category.	He	just	didn't	want	to	leave	his	activity.	She	tried	pausing	the activity	to	encourage	him	to	use	the	potty-no	dice.	She	tried	bringing	a	toy	to the	 potty-no	 dice.	 She	 even	 tried	 having	 him	 help	 clean	 up,	 but	 since	 he couldn't	really	touch	the	poop,	it	didn't	seem	to	faze	him.	When	I	suggested	a consequence,	 she	 fought	 me	 tooth-and-nail.	 She	 didn't	 see	 the	 difference between	a	consequence	and	a	reward,	and	she	preferred	to	reward	rather	than punish.

I'll	 tell	you	what	I	told	Rachel,	and	what	I'll	say	in	the	book	many	times:	I don't	believe	in	rewards	for	expected	behavior.	If	you	want	to	give	it	a	go,	that's fine.	I've	personally	seen	it	create	much	more	trouble	than	good.	I	don't	think	a sticker	or	a	little	candy	is	enough	to	change	a	behavior.	I	also	don't	think	sticker charts	work.	I	don't	think	a	child	has	the	thought	process	to	say,	'Oh,	I	have four	 stickers	 this	 week;	 three	 more,	 and	 I	 get	 a	 prize.'	 I've	 seen	 kids	 learn	 to meter	out	pee	and	poop	to	get	more	rewards,	and	I've	seen	candy	create	bigger power	struggles	during	potty	training.	It's	not	worth	it.	Occasionally,	I	will	see	a kid	who	I	can't	quite	figure	out-has	he	actually	learned	it	or	not?-and	even	in that	case,	a	small	consequence	can	help.	Again,	this	doesn't	require	being	mean. It's	just	a	way	of	bumping	up	the	child's	level	of	caring	about	learning	the	new skill.

Rachel	 ended	 up	 taking	 away	 a	 small	 toy	 every	 time	 Sean	 pooped	 in	 an inappropriate	place.	It	wasn't	drama	filled	or	anything;	just	a	'you	do	this	and	I do	that'	bumping-up	of	consequences.	Within	two	days,	Sean	was	pooping	on the	 potty	 just	 fine.	 For	 whatever	 reason,	 he	 just	 needed	 that	 extra	 external motivation.	 I'll say more	 about	 this	 in	 chapter	 13, 'Behavior	 vs. Potty

## Training.'

If	several	days	have	gone	by	and	you	are	not	getting	any	poop	at	all,	it's	very important	 to	 clean	 your	 child	 out.	 You	 can	 consult	 with	 your	 pediatrician regarding	 some	 child-approved	 stool	 softeners.	 A	 big	 potential	 problem	 with child-friendly	stool	softeners	is	getting	the	right	dosage.	I	suggest	you	go	easy	on the	dosage	to	begin	with.	We	just	want	to	soften	things	up,	not	create	a	mess. 'Poop	foods'	(high	fiberish)	are	fine	as	well	but	often	don't	have	quite	the	same effect	as	a	stool	softener,	and	if	you	overdo	them,	some	can	be	constipating.

I	 know	many	moms	have	successfully	used	pediatric	suppositories.	I	used	to think	suppositories	were	an	end-of-the-line	extreme	measure.	Slowly,	more	and more	 moms	 were	 reporting	 back	 to	 me	 that	 they	 used	 suppositories	 to great effect.	It's	something	to	consider	if	you	are	having	trouble	with	a	child	holding. Two	things	I	think	are	great	is	that:	(1)	suppositories	have	no	side	effects,	and (2)	the	poop	comes	within	fifteen	to	thirty	minutes.	Often	a	stool	softener	can take	up	to	a	day	to	work	its	magic	and	still	more	often,	can	create	a	poopy	mess.

The	 big	 problems	 with	 backed-up	 poop	 are	 that:	 (a)	 it	 will	 get	 hard	 and create	some	pain	when	it	finally	does	come;	and	(b)	it	can	really	press	up	against the	bladder,	causing	many	more	pee	accidents.

## Past	Rectal	Pain	or	Any	Butt	Trauma

Consider	whether	your	child	has	had	any	sort	of	rectal	pain	before.	I've	worked with	 all	 kinds	 of	 kids	 who've	 had	 all	 kinds	 of	 butt	 trauma.	 Some	 kids	 have constipation	from	an	early	age.	Some	kids	have	needed	surgery	on	their	genitals or	anus.	Some	kids	have	had	blood	in	their	stools.	If	your	child	has	had	any	kind of	rectal	pain	or	butt	trauma,	naturally	we	want	to	take	potty	training	slow	and easy.	Always	start	potty	training	with	some	sort	of	stool	softener.	You	absolutely want	the	first	potty	training	poops	to	be	easy	ones.	Always	validate	to	your	child that	you	know	he	has	had	a	hard	time	in	the	past.	Try	not	to	ever	use	the	word hurt .	 Once	 a	 child	 associates	 that	 word	 with	 the	 potty	 and	 starts	 using	 it,	 it's very	hard	to	ascertain	if	he	is	truly	in	pain	or	just	doesn't	want	to	go.	The	word hurt is	the	quickest	way	to	get	straight	to	your	heart.	Instead,	I	use	phrases	like, 'had	 a	 hard	 time,'	 'it's	 been	 uncomfortable,' etc. We	 don't	 want	 to	 add	 any emotional	charge	to	this	process.

For	 kids	 with	 trauma,	 you	 can't	 convince	 them	 that	 it's	 going	 to	 be	 easy. They	know	it	has	hurt	in	the	past,	and	that's	all	they	know.	This	is	when	a	little Mommy	Magic	can	go	a	long	way.	Much	as	the	placebo	effect	of	your	kiss	heals most	wounds,	we	can	use	your	Mommy	Magic	here	for	poop.	You	can	give	the stool	softener	in	juice	(this	works	well	with	prune	juice)	and	call	it	Magic	Poop Juice.	 You	can	cast	a	'magic	spell'	around	the	potty	chair	or	with	a	wand	on your	child's	head.	'My	poop	slides	out,	I	flush	it	down.	I'm	the	smartest	girl	in town'	or	something	similar.	If	your	child	will	let	you,	you	can	put	some	Vaseline or	coconut	or	olive	oil	around	her	anus.	Call	it	Magic	Poop	Lotion.	Any	other 'magic'	you	think	will	resonate	with	your	child	is	worth	a	try	to	smooth	this process.

These	suggestions	may	sound	utterly	ridiculous	to	you,	but	I	assure	you,	they work	 wonders.	 I've	 had	 lots	 of	 kids	 drink	 the	 Magic	 Poop	 Juice	 down	 and declare	within	minutes	that	they	have	to	poop.	What's	important	to	remember is	 that	 they're	dealing	with	a	made-up	fear	turned	into	a	real	one,	so	any	way you	can	dispel	the	fear	is	good.

## Your	Child	Is	Really	Trying	to	Make	It	to	the	Potty	But	Is	One	Second and	a	Half	a	Loaf	Too	Late

This	kid	is	awesome	and	we	have	to	give	him	props	for	trying.	He	just	needs	to recognize	the	feeling	a	little	sooner.	You	can	help	him	by	showing	him-drum roll,	please-The	Really	Gross	and	Really	Effective	Play-Doh	Poop	Trick:

I	 swear	 to	 God,	 one	 of	 the	 biggest	 problems	 with	 kids	 and	 those	 first	 few poops	 on	 the	 potty	 is	 they	 can't	 see	 what's	 going	 on.	 The	 feeling	 hits	 and	 a chasm	is	opening,	and	it	freaks	them	the	heck	out.

Here's	a	little	 trick	 that	 I	 find	 helps	 kids	 visually	 connect	 the	 feeling	 with what's	happening.	When	they	have	this	visual	it	clicks:	'Ooooh	.	.	.	so	when this	happens,	I	need	to	get	to	the	potty.'	This	is	great	for	kids	who	seem	to	be doing	their	best	to	get	to	the	potty	but	are	not	quite	making	it.	You	can	also	use it	for	the	kid	who	dances	around	for	ten	hours,	hops	on	and	off	the	potty,	and still	seems	weirded	out	by	pooping.

Get	yourself	some	Play-Doh.	Bonus	points	if	you	use	brown.	Make	a	fist.	The spot	where	your	thumb	curls	around	your	index	finger	is	a	reasonable	facsimile of	the	anus.	Tada!	Now	your	visual	is	ready.	Put	the	brown	Play-Doh	in	your	fist and	squeeze	some	out.	Yep.	Totally	gross.	Kids	love	it.	Explain	to	them,	'When your	poop	is	here	(tucked	inside	your	fist)	but	wants	to	come	out,	you	tell	me. When	your	poop	is	here	(squeezing	out	of	the	fist),	it's	already	out,	and	it's	too late.'	If	you	feel	really	brave,	you	can	explain	what	all	happens	with	the	anus opening.

This	is	usually	very	fun	and	informative	for	the	child.	For	most	kids,	a	total lightbulb	goes	off	for	them.	And	for	you,	it's	yet	another	parenting	moment	of thinking, Never	in	my	life	would	I	have	seen	myself	doing	this .

## Your	Child	Is	Doing	Great	with	Pee	But	Seems	Afraid	of	Pooping

This	child	is	doing	mostly	great,	but	the	poops	keep	landing	in	her	pants	or	on the	floor.	I	just	want	to	be	very	clear,	because	the	distinction	is	important:	this child	is	not	afraid	of pooping .	This	child	is	afraid	of pooping	on	the	potty .

The	number	one	thing	to	remember	in	the	case	of	this	child	is	that	the	fear	is real	 for	 him.	 As	 with	 any	 other	 fear-the	 monster	 under	 the	 bed,	 water,	 or whatever-no	amount	of	convincing	on	your	part	is	going	to	change	his	mind. So	stop	trying.

If	you're	dealing	with	this	child,	you	have	a	parenting	call	to	make,	and	I	do not	feel	 comfortable	 advising	 exactly	 what	 to	 do	 because	 it	 will	 depend	 upon your	child,	and	you	know	your	child	best.	What	I	can	do	is	to	give	you	some ideas.	Most	often,	I	tell	parents	to	do	what	they	would	do	with	any	other	toddler fear.	 If	 your	 toddler	 fears	 a	 monster	 under	 the	 bed,	 you	 don't	 keep	 her	 up	 all night,	right?	You	probably	combine	some	sternness	with	some	magical	thinking (like	using	a	stuffed	animal	sentry	or	a	'No	More	Monsters'	spray).	Same	idea applies	to	potty	training.	Having	your	child's	stuffed	animal	use	the	potty	first seems	to	work	miracles.	Also,	having	your	child	on	the	potty	in	the	bathroom while	you	are	going	works	well,	too.

Phew.	That's	a	lot	of	pooping	information.	Come	back	to	this	chapter	later	if you	need	to.	Don't	try	to	digest	this	all	info	if	it's	your	first	time	through	the book.	The	biggest	deal	with	poop	is	that	you	have	to	be	calm,	regardless	of	what your	child	is	doing.	Remember:	the	opposite	of	'holding	it'	is	letting	go.	Make	it safe	for	your	child	to	let	go.	That	means	you	stay	calm	and	steady.

## CHAPTER	11

## Prior	Attempts	at	Potty	Training

O ver	 the	 years	 I've	 been	 called	 upon	 increasingly	 often	 to	 fix	 potty	 training attempts	gone	awry.	Most	people	run	into	trouble	because	they've	waited	too long	or	have	been	too	casual	about	it.

This	chapter	is	for	you	if	you've	made	any	attempt	at	all	to	potty	train	that hasn't	gone	well.	I	want	to	be	clear:	I'm	not	saying	this	is	your	fault.	Still,	you've probably made	 some	 classic mistakes if your potty training hasn't been successful.

Often	 with	 my	 clients,	 I'm	 not	 called	 in	 until	 the	 entire	 process	 has disintegrated	into	a	huge	disaster.	Parents'	nerves	are	frayed,	if	not	completely shot.	Kids	are	ridiculously	resistant:	pooping	on	floors,	running	and	screaming from	 the	 potty	 chair,	 disrespecting	 and	 ignoring	 parents	 (who,	 to	 be	 fair,	 are pretty	 hysterical).	 I've	 seen	 it	 all,	 and	 I	 am	 not	 exaggerating.	 I	 know	 this	 is shocking,	but	potty	training	elicits	all	kinds	of	emotions	from	both	your	child and	 you.	 Still,	 sometimes	 what	 looks	 like	 chaos-once	 pulled	 apart-is	 a relatively	easy	fix.

While	 every	 child	 and	 every	 situation	 is	 slightly	 different,	 I	 have	 divided troublesome	trainings	into	four	main	categories,	which	I'll	label	only	to	give	you a	clearer	idea	of	what	you	are	working	with:

- 1.	'Kind	of	potty	trained'
- 2.	'Mostly	potty	trained'
- 3.	'Clueless'
- 4.	The	'child	from	hell'

So	let's	go	through	each	category	and	figure	out	what	went	wrong	and	how	to fix	it.

This	most	often	results	from	a	'let's	just	put	out	the	pot'	or	a	'we're	just	being really	 casual	 about	 this'	 attitude.	 Translation:	 you	 haven't	 really	 committed. Once	you	commit	to	 potty	 training,	 your	 child's	 abilities	 will	 follow	 in	 short order.

Where	to	go	from	here?	Just	pick	a	day	and	begin.	Follow	all	the	instructions in	chapter	5,	'Ditch	the	Diapers!	The	How-To.'	This	child	is	just	waiting	for you	to	show	up	with	consistency.	It	doesn't	much	matter	what	the	specifics	are.

Maybe	you	haven't	committed	because	he	hasn't	really	shown	much	interest. To	this,	I	say,	he	may never show	that	much	interest.	My	son	didn't	show	any interest	in	learning	to	tie	his	shoes.	In	fact,	he	said	he	didn't	want	to.	I	bought only	tie	shoes	and	he	learned. It	came	down	to	the	fact	that	I	knew	he	was	capable of	it. Don't	make	the	mistake	of	waiting	for	your	child.	There's	a	great	quote	I keep	hearing	from	parents	again	and	again:	'Wow.	It's	like	he	was	just	waiting for	me	to	take	off	the	diapers.'	Yes.	Your	child	expects	you	to	take	the	lead	in life.	It's	good.

The	 'kind	 of	 potty	 trained'	 child	 is	 an	 easy	 fix.	 With	 consistency	 and repetition,	this	child	should	be	done	in	a	short	amount	of	time,	as	long	as	you just	pick	a	day	and	start	in	with	Block	One.

## The	'Mostly	Potty	Trained'	Child

This	 kid	 is	 a	 little	 harder.	 The	 biggest	 problem	 here	 is	 that	 no	 one	 knows exactly	what's	going	on	in	this	kid's	mind.	She	knows	what	to	do	and	when	to do	it	and	mostly	does	it	just	fine.	However,	she	can	hold	pee	and/or	poop	until she	has	a	diaper	on	(naps	and	bedtime).	She	may	even	request	a	diaper	to	poop in.

As	best	I	can	tell,	this	scenario	is	the	result	of	waiting	too	long,	though	you most	likely	are	not	doing	anything	wrong	right	now.	It's	possible	that	you	may have	a	power	struggle	on	your	hands	in	this	case,	but	not	usually.	No,	this	one we	can	generally	chalk	up	to	toddler	weirdness.	After	about	two	and	a	half	years, toddlers	 come	 up	 with	 any	 number	 of	 bizarre	 fears.	 The	 beloved	 vacuum becomes	a	source	of	terror.	The	bed	becomes	a	home	for	monsters.	The	dark	all of	sudden	becomes	scary.	And,	not	surprisingly,	the	toilet	holds	all	kinds	of	dark secrets	that	toddlers	want	no	part	of.	Sometimes,	peeing	and	pooping-for	some unknown	toddler	reason-becomes	something	'not	to	do.'

For	this	child,	it's	absolutely	best	to	just	give	up all diapers.	You	can	go	back and	breeze	through	the	blocks	of	learning.	It	might	be	helpful	to	see	if	she	is successful	with	the	potty	while	naked,	and	the	trouble	comes	when	you	try	to put	clothes	on	her.	I	would	definitely	review	chapter	10,	'Poop.'	Still,	you	really have	no	option	but	to	ditch	the	diapers.	There	will	most	likely	be	some	fighting and	some	dancing	around,	but	in	the	end,	it's	worth	the	struggle.

A	lot	of	parents	feel	like	they	are	traumatizing	the	child	by	taking	the	diapers away-they're	not.	I've	mentioned	before	that	I've	had	clients	whose	kids	were kicked	 out	 of	 kindergarten	 for	 not	 being	 properly	 trained.	 They	 had	 to	 poop while	at	school	and	could	only	poop	in	a	diaper	they	requested.	They	were	asked to	 leave.	 That,	 to	 me,	 is	 truly	 traumatizing.	 Avoiding	 that	 trauma	 is	 worth	 a weekend	of	struggle.

Most	often,	poop	is	the	problem	for	this	child,	not	pee.	A	good	approach	is	to give	a	mild	stool	softener	and	say,	'We	are	not	using any diapers	anymore.	You should	poop	during	the	day	on	the	potty,	like	Mommy	and	Daddy	do.'

This	child	is	almost	always	older	and	quite	articulate.	No	matter	what,	you should	ask	your	child	what	she	thinks	the	problem	is.	I've	heard	kids	say	wild things:	'There's	a	shark	Transformer	in	the	toilet	bowl,	and	if	I	poop	he's	gonna come	eat	my	butt'	is	just	one	example.	It's	good	to	find	out	what	your	child	is thinking.	Even	if	it	seems	absurd	to	you,	it	is	totally	valid	to	your	child.	You	may simply	have	to	reassure	your	child	that	nothing	bad	is	going	to	happen	if	they poop	or	pee	in	the	toilet.

Make	sure	you're	not	pressuring	your	child.	This	problem	will	not	be	solved by	any	amount	of	begging,	bargaining,	asking,	or	logic.	You	also	want	to	check in	with	your	poop	values.	Remember	those?	Your	'poop	values'	are	how	you	feel about	pooping.	If	you're	sending	the	message	that	pooping	is	the	most	disgusting thing	on	the	planet,	your	child	probably	will	have	an	issue	with	poop.

Bottom	line,	make	the	'new	way'	(no	diapers)	an	absolute,	regardless	of	the emotional	fallout.	I	often	take	this	out	of	the	potty	training	context	to	explain	it better.	Say	you	have	to	suddenly	move.	You	don't	want	to	move,	nor	does	your child,	 but	 you	 have	 to	 move	 next	 week. You	 can't	 change	 that .	 You	 can	 only move	forward	and	do	your	best	with	the	resulting	behavior.	With	this	child	and potty	 training,	 you	 want	 to	 take	 that	 same	 approach.	 You	 have	 to know that continuing	diapers	potentially	could	lead	to	even	more	trouble	down	the	road. This	is	the	new	way.	Period.

## The	'Clueless'	Child

This	child	shows	no	indication	of	knowing	what	the	hell	you	are	talking	about when	 you	 say	 'potty.'	 Assuming	 there	 are	 no	 emotional	 or	 developmental delays,	the	truly	'clueless'	child	is	probably	too	young	(which	isn't	to	say	it	can't be	done,	just	that	it	will	just	take	longer).	Remember,	the	truly	'clueless'	will pee	 as	 she	 is	 walking,	 slip	 on	 the	 pee,	 and	 still	 not	 know	 what	 the	 hell	 just happened.	The	flip	side	of	the	'clueless	and	too	young'	child	is	the	'clueless	and too	 old'	 child.	 If	 your	 child	 is	 over	 three	 years	 of	 age	 and	 appears	 to	 be 'clueless,'	 she	 is	 pretending.	 She	 is	 under	 the	 impression	 that	 if	 she	 ignores potty	training,	it	will	go	away.

If	 your	 child	 is	 younger	 than	 twenty-two	 months	 and	 shows absolutely no indication	that	she	knows	what's	happening,	you	might	want	to	try	again	in	a month	or	two.	Be	careful	though.	Make	sure	this	isn't	just	an	excuse	on	your part.	 Make	 sure	 there's	 really no indication;	 she's	 truly	 'clueless.'	 Go	 back	 to chapter	2,	'When	to	Start,'	and	review	the	'markers'	that	I	discussed.	If	your child	shows	even	the	slightest	indication	that	she	knows	what's	happening,	you should	move	forward	with	potty	training.	You	may	have	to	work	a	little	harder or	be	a	little	more	vigilant,	but	you	shouldn't	give	up.

A	very	different	species	is	the	'clueless'	older	child.	This	child	will	appear deaf	 to	 prompting,	 may	 completely	 ignore	 you,	 and	 pretty	 much	 act	 like	 he's never	heard	the	word potty in	his	life.	In	this	case,	you	should	refer	to	chapter 15,	'Younger	Than	Twenty	Months,	Older	Than	Three	Years.'

I've	seen	this	scenario	fixed	in	half	a	day,	and	I've	seen	it	take	two	days,	so	be prepared.	Don't	be	afraid	to	enlist	someone's	help.	Sometimes,	you	(the	parent) are	too	enmeshed	emotionally.	Have	a	friend,	babysitter,	or	Grandma	help	out.

Results	are	usually	quicker	with	someone	else,	just	because	our	kids	like	to	drive us	crazy.

Whatever	you	do,	when	you	decide	it's	time	for	potty	training	to	happen, you cannot	go	back	to	diapers! And	be	very,	very	careful	not	to	threaten	that	you	will go	back	to	diapers.	This	child	can	be	working	your	very	last	nerve.	Be	sure	you are	giving	good	attention	and	love	elsewhere.	I've	seen	parents	get	very	resentful and	be	sort	of	bitchy	all	the	time	with	this	type	of	kid.	All	the	more	reason	to clean	it	up	once	and	for	all.

## The	'Child	from	Hell'

This	 child	 is	 the	 best	 of	 the	 worst.	 He	 is	 similar	 to	 the	 'clueless'	 older	 child except	he's	waaaay	more	vocal	about	wanting	potty	training	to	disappear.	This child	is	almost	always	older	than	three,	and	he	means	business.	He will	not potty train.

Something	happened	along	the	way	during	potty	training,	the	result	of	which is	that	he	has	decided	not	to	play	along	with	you.	It	could	have	been	anything, big	or	small.	I	wouldn't	waste	too	much	time	going	over	what	you	may	or	may not	have	done.	The	most	important	thing	to	remember	is	that	kids	age	three and	up are	fully	capable	of	understanding	all	aspects	of	potty	training .	He	isn't	saying no	 because	 of	 mixed	 messages	 or	 confusion.	 He	 is	 saying	 no	 to	 piss	 you	 off and/or	 assert	 his	 will.	 This	 situation	 requires	 immediate	 action,	 because	 this child	is	cutting	off	his	nose	to	spite	his	face-just	to	prove	he	can.

With	the	'child	from	hell,'	you	have	a	true	power	struggle.	He	knows	where pee	and	poop	go.	He	is	aware	of	the	feeling	of	having	to	go.	He	is	aware	of	the frustration	and	drama	he	is	creating.	Consequently,	it's	time	for	you	to	be	a	little hard-core.	This	child	needs	no	coddling,	praise,	or	other	accolades	around	potty training.	Basically,	he's	saying	'F**k	you.'

It's	wise	to	keep	in	mind	that	this	situation	(or,	the	resultant	power	struggle) is	 rarely	 about	potty	training.	This	is	about	who	is	running	your	house.	And	I bet	if	you've	gotten	to	this	point,	it's	not	you	who's	running	the	show.	I'm	not saying	that	to	cast	blame	or	judgment.	Our	kids	are	constantly	walking	this	line, and	we	can	lose	control	without	even	realizing	it.

If	 this	 sounds	 like	 your	 situation,	 first,	 take	 a	 deep	 breath	 and	 be	 kind	 to yourself.	This	happens	sometimes,	and	the	idea	is	to	fix	it,	not	ruminate	on	how it	got	that	way.	On	the	other	hand,	I'm	going	to	be	hard-core	with	you.	Things have	to	change	now,	for	reasons	of	dignity.	Your	child	is	too	smart	and	too	old to	be	using	a	diaper,	period.	And	if	your	child	is	using	this	as	a	method	of	being disrespectful	to	you	in	any	way,	you	want	to	change	that	now!

Logistically speaking, you'll be hard-pressed to find a preschool or kindergarten	that	will	accept	an	untrained	child.	Also,	it	almost	goes	without saying,	but	do	you	want	your	child	to	learn	to	use	the	potty	through	shaming	by his	 peers?	 Four-and	 five-year-olds	 are	 already	 starting	 to	 tease,	 taunt,	 and	 call names.	 What	 do	 you	 think	 is	 going	 to	 happen	 to	 your	 child	 who's	 still	 not trained?	It	won't	be	pretty.

This	child	requires	the	big	guns:	a	combination	of	all	our	tools.	When	it	does become	time	to	train,	he's	probably	too	big	for	the	little	potty	chair,	so	go	right for	the	toilet.	I	would	give	this	child	the	benefit	of	the	doubt	that	there	could	be a	 gap	 in	 learning,	 so	 go	 ahead	 and	 proceed	 through	 the	 blocks	 as	 described earlier	in	the	book,	but	do	so	at	a	fast	pace.	Because	in	reality,	this	is	probably just	a	behavior	issue.	Still	.	.	.	it's	good	to	be	sure.

You	definitely	 want	 to	 ditch	 all	 the	 diapers	 at	 once.	 There	 just	 can	 be no other	 option .	 You	 also	 want	 to	 utilize	 silence.	 Your	 child	 has	 you	 wound	 tight right	 now.	 I'm	 sure	 you	 have	 tried	 everything.	 So	 now,	 try	 nothing.	 Stop	 the dance	around	him.	You	may	need	to	stay	home	and	keep	your	child	home	for	a few	days.	There	will	most	likely	be	a	full	day	of	accidents,	but	again,	there's	only so	 far	 a	 kid	 will	 go	 when	 there's	 no	 show	 around	 it.	 What's	 the	 point	 of consistently	peeing	yourself	when	Mom	doesn't	react?

If	your	child	is	pooping	on	the	floor,	I	want	to	emphasize	that	this	isn't	about potty	 training-it's	 simply	 total	 disrespect.	 If	 this	 is	 happening,	 as	 I	 discuss further	 in	 chapter	 15	 ('Younger	 Than	 Twenty	 Months,	 Older	 Than	 Three Years'),	you	probably	need	more	specific	help	than	I	can	offer	via	this	book.	I would	 honestly	 and	 gently	 say	 you	 may	 need	 a	 family	 therapist.	 You	 have	 a bigger	issue	than	just	poop.

Assuming	no	greater	looming	psychological	issues,	though,	if	you	can	manage to	 stay	 absolutely	 neutral	 for	 a	 day	 or	 two,	 your	 child	 should	 get	 on	 board.	 I cannot	stress	this	enough:	it's	your	reaction	that	is	fueling	your	child	(who,	to	be fair,	is	being	a	pain	in	the	ass,	so	cut	yourself	some	slack).

The	'child	from	hell'	is	an	expert	at	appearing	to	not	care	about	anything. Rewards,	 punishments	 .	 .	 .	 nothing	 seems	 to	 affect	 him-which	 is	 absolutely infuriating.	A	good	way	to	deal	with	this	situation	is	to	think, What	is	she	getting from	 this? There's	 always	 a	 payoff	 when	 a	 child	 is	 acting	 out	 of	 control,	 be	 it physical	or	emotional.	Think	of	what	your	child's	payoff	is	and	remove	it.

As	in	any	of	the	other	cases	 discussed	 above,	 be	 sure	 to	 confine	 the	 potty issues	 to	 the	 potty.	 Sometimes,	 these	 kids	 seem	 so	 'bad'	 that	 parents	 start	 to dislike	them,	and	it	flows	out	into	other	areas	of	life.	Be	sure	to	give	lots	of	love and	hugs	and	positive	attention	around	the	good	things	your	child	does.	I	know it	can	be	tricky,	but	you	can	do	it.

I	wouldn't	use	these	words	in	any	other	area	of	parenting	but	this-the	'child from	hell'	scenario-is	about	winning.	You	need	to	win	this	particular	fight.	It's about	who's	in	charge,	and	it	simply	has	got	to	be	you.	If	your	child	is	running the	show,	it's	unsafe.	When	I	say	'win,'	I	don't	mean	you	should	engage	in	a power	struggle,	but	you	should	mean	business.	It	most	likely	will	not	be	easy,	but it	will	be	better	in	the	long	run	for	your	child	and	the	harmony	of	your	home. The	'new	way'	must	be	the	absolute,	and	that	means	putting	pee	and	poop	in the	potty.

So,	to	recap:	if	you're	dealing	with	any	of	these	scenarios,	you'll	need	to	go through	the	blocks	of	learning	discussed	in	chapter	5,	'Ditch	the	Diapers!	The How-To.'	Your	child	may	breeze	through	or	get	stuck	on	some,	but	the	process should	give	you	a	more	organized	sense	of	what	went	wrong	and	where.	If	you think	you	need	a	big	breather	to	gain	some	fortitude,	that	is	fine.	In	chapter	16, 'The	Reset,'	I	lay	out	the	plan	for	rediapering	while	you	regroup.	Every	one	of the	groups	of	kids	described	above	could	do	a	reset,	if	you	think	you	need	one. Don't	worry:	a	reset	is	not	a	step	back.	We	need	you	in	the	right	frame	of	mind. You	are	driving	this	particular	car.

## CHAPTER	12

## Day	Cares	and	Other	Caregivers

O kay-day	cares	can	throw	a	major	wrench	in	the	potty	training	process.	I	used to	 believe	 that	 everything	 hinged	on	having	your	day	care	on	board.	But	I've changed	my	mind	a	bit	and	have	helped	many,	many	parents	negotiate	success with	or	without	the	day	care's	cooperation.

Before	 you	 even begin potty	 training,	 find	 out	 your	 day	 care's	 policy.	 Most larger	day	cares	will	have	a	formal	policy.	Home	day	cares	and	nanny	situations may	not	have	a	formal	policy,	but	they'll	still	have	their	own	opinion	of	how this	should	go	down.	So find	out .	Ask	them	many	questions.	Many	day	cares	say they	will	work	with	you,	but	you'll	find	later	that	they	really	won't.	Alternately, they	may	have	some	weird	notions	of	what	they	can	and	can't	do.	It's	best	to find	 out	 what	 they	 do	 before	 you	 walk	 in	 on	 a	 Monday	 morning	 and	 are shocked.	Some	day	cares	are	well	versed	in	potty	training	and	will	help	as	much as	 they	 can.	 The	 bummer	 is	 that	 most	 aren't,	 so	 here's	 the	 un-sugar-coated version	of	what's	going	on.

In	September	2012,	I	was	inundated	with	emails	from	all	over	the	country. These	 were	 official	 positions	 from	 day	 cares,	 specifically	 stating	 that	 children MUST	be	fully	potty	trained	while	wearing	a	pull-up.	The	diaper	was	not	to	be removed	until	 the	 child	 could	 stay	 dry	 in	 said	 pull-ups	 for	 two	 solid	 weeks.	 I have	no	idea	what	went	on	in	the	world	to	create	this	official	stance.	But	it	was very strange coming from so many different places in the country simultaneously.

Somehow,	this	became	the	'official'	policy	of	many	day	cares.	I	get	it.	It's	not easy	for	a	day	care	to	deal	with	potty	training.	Not	having	to	deal	with	potty training	is	a	huge	load	off	their	minds	and	hands.	Potty	training	a	large	group	of children	 isn't	 easy,	 I	 realize.	 I	 also	 realize	 that	 each	 state	 may	 have	 its	 own regulations	 regarding	 certain	 aspects	 of	 potty	 training	 (such	 as	 cleanup	 and having	 a	 child	 go	 unassisted	 to	 the	 bathroom).	 Still,	 I	 want	 to	 point	 out	 the ludicrousness	of	this	supposed	policy.

How	on	earth	can	you	expect	a	child	to	learn	a	new	behavior	while	actively engaging	in	the	old	behavior?	Have	you	ever	tried	to	get	a	kid	to	eat	broccoli while	 he's	 munching	 on	 candy?	 Or	 let's	 say	 you	 want	 to	 cut	 down	 on	 TV watching.	By	this	logic,	you	should	keep	the	TV	on	until	the	child	is	ready	to watch	less. This	is	nearly	impossible, and	actually	requires	a	huge	amount	of	skill and	thought	from	a child .	It	really,	really	makes	my	head	almost	explode.

The	people	who	should	be	the	most	informed	about	child	development	are all	just	nodding	their	heads	as	if	this	new	recommendation	makes	perfect	sense. WTF?

So,	back	to	day	cares.	What	I've	heard	from	many	providers	is	they	simply don't	have	the	time	to	attend	to	a	child	with	the	speed	necessary	during	potty training.	 In	 other	 words,	 they	 know	 that	 when	 a	 kid's	 gotta	 go,	 he's	 gotta	 go now ,	 and	they	can't	respond	that	quickly.	That's	kind	of	messed	up,	don't	you think?	It	makes	me	wonder	how	long	these	kids	are	sitting	in	dirty	diapers.

What	 is	 more	 important	 than	 learning	 a	 life	 skill?	 Imagine	 if	 a	 day	 care offered to	 potty	train.	Holy	crap:	they'd	have	a	waiting	list	five	years	long	and could	 charge	 double.	 What	 are	 they	 doing	 that's	 more	 important	 than	 that? Learning	shapes	and	colors	and	dramatic	play	is	all	well	and	good,	but	learning to	put	pee	and	poop	in	the	potty?	Even	better.

Day	 cares	 are	 essentially	 screwing	 you,	 especially	 if	 you	 are	 a	 full-time working	 mom	 or	 dad.	 (Though	 I'm	 sure	 you're	 used	 to	 getting	 screwed	 by everything at this point, eh?) Because immediately after day care comes preschool,	and	guess	what?	Preschools	demand	absolute,	full-on	potty	trained.

Ridiculous,	yes?	Yes.	It	ticks	me	off	to	no	end.	But	the	reality	is	I'm	sure	your day	care	does	care	wonderfully	for	your	child,	and	I'm	sure	you	don't	have	much of	a	choice,	so	we'll	deal	with	what	we've	got.	I'll	go	through	the	best	way	to	set you	and	your	child	up	for	success,	and	how	to	deal	with	the	less	ideal	scenarios.

Take	off	as	many	days	in	a	row	as	possible	to	start	potty	training.	Something like	a	three-day	weekend	with	one	extra	day	tacked	on	is	usually	great.	I	know this	is	not	the	ideal	way	to	spend	a	precious	vacation	day,	but	it's	worth	it	in	the end.	If	you	can	take	even	more	time	off,	that's	great.	If	day	care	is	more	a	social thing	 and	 not	 a	 necessity,	 consider	 keeping	 your	 child	 home	 for	 a	 couple	 of extra	days.

In	that	time	frame,	while	potty	training, really try	 to	 learn	 your	 child's	 pee pattern.	 Remember,	that's	how	much	and	how	often	your	child	typically	pees after x amount	of	fluid.	The	good	news	is	most	day	cares	have	a	sort	of	formal routine	for	snacks	and	such,	so	usually	fluid	intake	is	controlled.	Still,	you	want to	have	an	overall	awareness	so	you	can	pass	on	the	information.

As	 you	 are	 potty	 training,	 be	 sure	 you	 are	 saying	 to	 your	 child	 what	 you would	 like him to	 say.	 Remember	 when	 you	 were	 teaching	 'bye-bye,'	 you probably	very	naturally	said his words:	'Bye-bye,	Grandma!'	Right?	Probably	in a	high	squeaky	voice,	too.	And	eventually	he	started	saying	'bye-bye.'

Same	thing	with	potty	training.	So	as	you	are	getting	him	to	the	potty	you would	say,	'Mama,	go	potty'	or	'Mama,	pee.'	Something	along	those	lines.	This is	 something	 that all parents	 should	 do,	 but	 it's	 especially	 important	 for	 you because,	ideally,	we	need	your	child	asking	to	pee	as	soon	as	possible	when	he returns	to	the	day	care	(realistically,	though,	self-initiation	doesn't	fully	begin until	one	to	three	weeks	after	your	start	date).

Don't	 worry	 about	 the	 nap	 diaper	 at	 day	 care.	 Send	 a	 diaper.	 It's	 a	 pretty useless	fight	that	you	probably	won't	win.

The	commando	issue	is	a	big	one	that	day	cares	resist.	I	think	everyone	is	just weirded out by the idea of no underwear. I wouldn't even ask their opinion/permission	 if	 you	 can	 help	 it.	 Wearing	 underwear	 is	 simply	 too confusing	 for	 your	 child	 in	 the	 beginning.	 The	 snugness	 creates	 a	 muscle memory	of	a	diaper,	and	the	covering	suggests	privacy.	I	can	almost	bet	you	that your	child	will	have	more	accidents	if	you	put	undies	on	her	too	soon.	Many schools	will	claim	it's	a	regulation.	It	very	well	may	be.	But	try	to	get	the	actual wording	of	the	regulation	and	see	if	there's	a	creative	work-around.	Sometimes, it's	about	the	poop	dropping	on	the	floor.	See	if	your	child	can	wear	pants	with elastics	around	the	ankles	to	hold	the	poop.	In	my	experience,	a	lot	of	day	cares just	really	don't	want	to	take	this	on.	But	remember,	these	people are in	charge of	your	child	for	many	hours.	You	don't	want	to	be	too	contentious.

Let's	say	it's	gone	pretty	well	at	home.	Your	child	is	getting	it	but	isn't	done by	any	means.	The	day	you	return	to	day	care,	fill	the	teacher	in.	When	you	first get	there,	take	your	child	to	the	bathroom	and	show	her	the	ropes	and	anything particular	to	school.	If	the	bathroom	is	not	accessible	to	your	child,	ask	to	have a	 potty	 chair	 in	 the	 room.	 If	 they	 don't	 allow	 that,	 I'd	 seriously	 considering moving	day	cares.	It's imperative that	 your	 child	 have	 access	 to	 the	 bathroom. Not	 just for ease but because, ideally, we	 want	 your child doing this independently.

Tell	your	child	clearly who is	available	to	help	him.	Name	names,	point,	have a	discussion	with	the	adult	and	your	child.	Day	care	can	get	confusing,	and	you want	your	child	to	be	sure	he	knows	who	to	ask	for	help,	even	if	it	seems	totally obvious.	In	pointing	out	a	source	of	help,	scope	out	his	favorite	teacher.	There's always	a	preferred	staff	at	day	care.	Look	for	the	good	cop,	the	sweet	one,	the patient	one-find	her	(or	him)	and	give	directives	to	that	one.	Don't	go	to	the meanie,	if	there	is	one.

It's	perfectly	fine	if	they	take	the	children	at	set	intervals.	It's	not	how	I	potty train	 at	 home,	 but	 with	 groups	 of	 children,	 it	 works	 wonders.	 The	 herd mentality	works	in	our	favor	here.	They	need	to	be	taking	the	children	at	least once	an	hour,	preferably	every	thirty	minutes	or	so.	I	had	a	day	care	tell	me	they didn't	have	the	time	except	for	once	every	two	hours!!!	That's	too	long	(and kinda	bullshit	if	you	ask	me).

If	you	know	your	child's	pee-pee	dance,	let	the	care	provider(s)	know.	Again, there	are	obvious	classic	dances,	like	hopping	from	foot	to	foot,	but	some	kids get	really	quiet	and	some	may	get	louder.	Whatever	your	kid	does,	let	the	day care	know	about	it	if	you	can.

Arrange	a	special	signal	between	the	teacher	and	your	child.	The	best	one	is having	 your	 child	 tug	 on	 the	 teacher's	 arm.	 I	 don't	 know	 why,	 but	 children sometimes	 get	 embarrassed	 about	 asking	 to	 go	 to	 the	 potty	 and	 drawing attention	 to	 themselves.	 You'd	 think	 pooping	 in	 your	 pants	 at	 the	 sand	 table would	 be	 at	 least	 equally	 embarrassing,	 but	 it's	 not.	 Go	 figure.	 Anyway,	 a nonverbal	signal	can	nip	this	in	the	bud.

Ask	the	teacher	 to	 please	 save	 your	 child's	 spot	 whenever	 she	 goes	 to	 the bathroom.	This	is	a	big	one.	Many,	many	children	are	fearful	of	losing	their	spot and/or	the	toy	they	were	playing	with.	Once	they	know	they	won't	lose	these, they	are	more	likely	to	take	potty	breaks.

Make	 sure	 the	 teacher	 isn't	 staring	 them	 down	 while	 they	 try	 to	 use	 the potty.	Every	place	has	a	different	arrangement.	If	there's	a	stall	and	low	toilets, the	 teacher	 can	 take	 your	 child	 to	 the	 bathroom	 and	 semiclose	 the	 door.	 If there're	potty	chairs	in	the	room,	great;	just	discourage	hovering.	I	had	a	little girl,	Emily,	who	was	doing	fine	at	home.	However,	at	day	care,	she	would	hold	it and	hold	it	and	she	would	try	to	sit,	but	wouldn't	pee.	The	teacher	was	getting sort	of	aggravated.	After	some	questioning,	it	turns	out	she	was	hovering	over Emily,	pretty	much	demanding	that	something	happen.	It	won't	work	that	way. Once	the	teacher	started	being	more	casual	and	averting	her	own	eyes,	Emily did	great!

Same	deal	as	above	for	pooping.	Pooping	needs	privacy.

Check	 out	 where	 the	 other	 kids	 are	 in	 the	 potty	 training	 process.	 If	 your child	is	the	first	one	diving	in,	use	that.	Tell	your	child	he's	the	first	and	he	can show	them	all	how	to	do	it.	If	he's	the	last,	use	it.	Tell	him	he	wants	to	be	a	big kid	like	the	other	kids.	If	there	are	others	at	the	same	stage,	use	it.	Tell	him	who else	is	doing	this	so	he's	not	alone.

If	 day	 cares	 use	 a	 reward	 system,	 it's	 fine.	 Just	 stay	 steady	 at	 home	 with	 no rewards.	 If	 you	 child	 asks	 for	 one	 at	 home,	 simply	 say,	 'Oh,	 no.	 That	 only happens	 at	 school,	 honey.'	 In	 my	 experience,	 it's	 never	 been	 a	 problem	 or confusing.	 Not	 ideal,	 but	 the	 school	 has	 to	 deal	 with	 that	 potential	 treat monster.	 The	 children	 I've	 worked	 with	 have	 never	 had	 an	 issue	 with	 things being	different	at	home.

Those	are	all	the	big	things.	You	don't	want	to	overwhelm	your	day	care	with a	 huge	list	 of	 instructions.	 You	 should	 get	 a	 feel	 for	 how	 they	 are	 going	 to	 be with	 this	 by	 asking	 a	 few	 simple	 questions.	 A	 sample	 conversation	 might	 go something	like	this:

'Hi!	 We're	 going	 to	 start	 potty	 training	 Sally	 over	 the	 long	 weekend.	 We believe	the	best	approach	is	to	remove	daytime	diapers.	We'd	be	delighted	if	you could	help	us	in	this	process.	How	do	you	typically	handle	potty	training?	I'm sure	 you	 have	 vast	 experience.	 We'd	 like	 to	 combine	 forces	 with	 you	 for	 the most	successful	outcome	for	Sally.

'Do	you	take	the	children	who	are	potty	training	to	the	washroom	at	certain intervals?	 How	often?	How	many	accidents	do	you	'allow'	before	requesting	a

## diaper	be	put	on?

'As	long	as	Sally	is	showing	progress	I'm	sure	we	can	work	on	this	together.

'I	 really	 value	 you	 as	 Sally's	 care	 provider.	 We	 feel	 the	 timing	 is	 right	 for potty	training.	Anything	we	can	do	to	assist	you,	please	let	us	know.'

In	 saying	 this,	 you've	 stated	 what	 you	 would	 like	 in	 no	 uncertain	 terms, you've	 done	 a	 fair	 amount	 of	 transparent	 ass	 kissing,	 and	 you've	 stated	 how much	you	value	the	day	care.	All	good	things.

You	most	likely	will	get	a	response	like,	'We'll	work	with	you	however	you're doing	it.'	Sounds	great,	but	ask	more	questions!	I've	had	so	many	parents	gloss over	this	and	end	up	with	a	nightmare.

I	 don't	 know	 why,	 but	 day	 cares	 can	 cop	 an	 attitude	 regarding	 who	 knows more	about	child	development.	They	may	say,	'It	won't	happen	till	age	three,' or	 'Children	 can	 only	 potty	 train	 in	 pull-ups.'	 Somehow	 it	 becomes	 a	 little power	 struggle	 about	 who	 knows	 best.	 The	 best	 way	 is	 simply	 to	 state	 your desires	for	your	child.	A	good	day	care	will	do	their	best	to	work	with	you.	What a	day	care	is	not	allowed	to	do	is	to	rediaper	your	child	without	your	permission, unless	there's	an	emergency,	such	as	an	episode	of	diarrhea.

Quick	 tangent:	 I	 potty	 trained	 Pascal	 at	 twenty-two	 months.	 He	 was	 at	 a lovely	home	day	care.	The	caregiver	completely	thought	he	was	too	young	to potty	train.	Now,	this	might	have	been	a	cultural	difference	because	she	was	fine with	her	five-year-old	drinking	from	a	bottle.	I	told	her	he	was	doing	great	at home	 and	 we'd	 not	 had	 one	 single	 accident.	 She	 was	 appalled	 at	 his	 going commando.	It	 was	 summer,	 and	 she	 felt	 that	 when	 he	 was	 playing,	 everyone could	see	his	penis.	I	was	like,	who	cares?	They're	all	under	two!	She	fought	me on	the	nap	diaper.	I	offered	to	bring	in	my	own	mattress	and	sheets	for	the	crib. She	refused.	Anyway,	it	was	a	huge	battle.	I	told	her	in	no	uncertain	terms	that he	was	not	to	be	in	a	diaper.	One	day,	I	arrived	there	earlier	than	usual	for	pick up.	He	had	a	diaper	on	with	his	underwear	over	it!	It	was crazy .	 We	switched day	cares	that	day.	Now,	I	live	in	a	city	that	has	many	day	care	options,	and	I realize	this	is	not	true	for	everyone.	Still,	it's	so	not	cool	for	a	day	care	to	agree with	you	to	your	face	and	then	do	something	else	entirely	behind	your	back.

My	advice	is	to	really	get	a	feel	 for	 your	 care	 provider's	 attitude.	 You'll	 be able	to	tell	just	by	body	language,	tone,	and	the	words	they	choose	how	they	are going	to	act.	Again,	this	is	where	some	day	cares	get	huffy	about	their	authority.

Don't	fight,	but	gently	prod	and	fully	express	how	you'd	like	potty	training handled.	Some	day	cares	will	pull	out	a	policy,	written	down-'cause	that	means it's	real-that	states	your	child	must	stay	in	diapers	until	potty	trained.	Gently try	 to	 work	 your	 way	 around	 this.	 The	 best	 way	 is	 to	 act totally stupid,	 like, 'Gee	.	.	.	that's	weird.	I	would	think	it'd	be	hard	to	learn	something	new	while actively	taking	part	in	the	old.	Hmmm	.	.	.	that	seems	very	odd.'

If	 it's	 looking	 like	 they	 won't	 budge,	 that's	 okay,	 too.	 As	 I	 stated	 at	 the beginning	of	this	chapter,	I	used	to	think	this	was	the	end	of	the	world.	But	it's not.

I	used	to	write	letters,	on	behalf	of	my	clients,	even	talk	to	day	cares	on	the phone.	Moms	would	be	getting	ulcers	trying	to	knock	sense	into	them.	And,	yes, we	got	our	way .	But	then	we	had	day	care	providers	on	edge-they	were	nervous wrecks,	totally	overprompting	and	hovering.	No	good.	We	need	this	process	to be	stress-free	for	your	child.	An	anxious	provider	is	going	to	derail	things	even more	than	a	diaper.

If	your	child has to	wear	a	diaper	at	day	care,	there's	just	not	much	you	can	do about	it.	What	you can do	is	keep	with	the	(diaper-free)	system	at	home.	Most parents	figure	out	a	way	to	make	this	work.	It	should	look	something	like	this:

Drop	him	off	at	day	care,	go	to	the	bathroom	for	a	pee,	put	the	diaper	on	him while	 in	 the	 bathroom.	 Tell	 him,	 'This	 is	 in	 case	 there's	 an	 accident.	 You should	tug	on	Miss	Suzy's	arm	when	you	have	to	go	pee,	or	you	can	come	by yourself'	(if	that's	true).	Say	no	more	and	no	less.	You're	not	letting	him	off	the hook	of	potty	training,	you're	not	suggesting	he	just	use	the	diaper	to	pee	in. You	 are	 being	 vague	 on	 purpose.	 You	 are	 assuming	 he	 will	 use	 the	 diaper	 as underpants.	It's	a	hard	way	to	potty	train,	but	it's	doable.

Same	deal	for	pick	up.	Go	to	the	bathroom	for	a	last	pee	before	the	car	ride home.	 Take	 off	 the	 diaper	 and	 leave	 it	 there	 (in	 the	 proper	 receptacle,	 of course).	Tell	him,	'We're	going	home	now,	and	you	don't	use	diapers	at	home. Remember	to	tell	me	when	your	are	going	to	go	pee.'

What	this	does	is	to	reinforce	the	notion	that	diapers	are	equated	with	day care.	It's	a	day	care	thing	and,	oddly,	this	generally	makes	sense	to	the	child.	If the	day	care	is	okay	with	changing	diapers,	so	be	it.

Having	 to	 do	 diapers	 at	 day	 care	 is	 not	 preferable,	 and	 it	 can	 make	 potty training drag out a bit, but not indefinitely. Still, having a stress-free environment	(rather	than	fighting	with	day	care)	is	going	to	make	this	so	much easier	for	all	of	you.

I	have	also	found	that	a	little	passive-aggressive	behavior	on	your	part	never hurts.	 You	 can	 say	 something	 along	 the	 lines	 of,	 'Well,	 she's	 doing	 great	 at home,	but	it's	 okay	 to	 wear	 a	 diaper	 here	 since	 you	 don't	 really	 handle	 potty training.	I	don't	want	you	to	be	nervous.'	So	yeah,	act	nice	and	slide	the	dig	in. I	understand	if	that's	not	your	cup	of	tea,	but	it	does	work.

I	 also	 find	 that	 day	 cares'	 attitudes	 depend	 upon	 what	you	tell	them,	so	be sure	to	focus	on	all	the	success.	If	you	walk	into	day	care	and	tell	them	it's	been nothing	but	a	struggle,	that's	exactly	what	they	are	going	to	see	(and,	I	swear, partially	create).	If	you	go	in	telling	them	it's	going	great,	they	will	feel	the	need to	follow	through	with	that.	If	it's	going	just	okay	at	home,	try	not	to	say	much of	anything.

If	your	child	is	having	very	little	success	at	home-and	I	mean	very	littleit's	 okay.	 Some	 kids	 do	 take	 longer	 to	 potty	 train	 than	 others	 do.	 In	 such	 a situation,	I'd	be	sure	to	check	in	with	the	day	care,	honestly.	Tell	them	you'd love	 to	 give	 it	 a	 shot	 at	 day	 care	 without	 a	 diaper	 to	 see	 if	 she's	 just	 being obnoxious	at	home.

I	know	this	is	shocking,	but	our	kids	can	be	angels	with	other	people	and	save all	 their	 crappy	 behavior	 for	 us,	 the	 parents.	 Enlist	 the	 day	 care's	 help	 as	 a resource:	'I	know	he's	so	good	for	you.	We've	done	potty	training	this	weekend and	it's	going	.	.	.	eh.	Would	you	be	willing	to	try	today	to	see	if	he	does	well with	 you?'	 This	 usually	 gets	 a	 favorable	 response,	 again	 thanks	 to	 some transparent	ass	kissing.

If	your	child	is	in	day	care	for	a	large	portion	of	the	day,	you	might	want	to consider	daytime	and	nighttime	potty	training	all	together,	at	the	same	time.	It can	look	overwhelming,	so	read	chapter	6,	'Nighttime	Training'	again	and	give it	 some	 thought.	 If	 day	 care	 insists	 on	 a	 diaper,	 and	 your	 child	 is	 there	 eight hours	a	day,	five	days	a	week,	she's	going	to	have	very	little	time	left	in	the	day without	a	diaper	on.	Just	something	to	consider.

So,	in	summary: find	out the	day	care's	policy	and/or	how	they	handle	potty training,	 with	 details.	 If	 they	 are	 willing	 and	 able,	 go	 for	 it.	 If	 they	 seem resistant,	try	to	bring	them	to	the	light.	If	they	are	adamant	about	a	diaper,	call out	their	stupidity	by	acting	really	stupid	yourself.	If	they	insist	on	the	diaper	at day	care,	proceed	with	potty	training	when	your	child	is	at	home.	If	you	need	to fudge	 facts	 and	 act	 a	 little	 passive-aggressive,	 this	 is	 survival,	 baby-it's	 okay. (Hey	.	.	.	where	else	do	you	get	this	free	pass?)

The	bottom	line	 is	 we	 can't	 hold	 off	 potty	 training	 until	 day	 cares	 get	 on board.	You	will	miss	the	window	of	opportunity.	You	also	will	not	have	much time	to	wrap	things	up	before	preschool	starts.	You	want	to	gently	push	the	issue as	much	as	possible,	but	it's	completely	doable	to	potty	train	while	your	child	is full-or	part-time	in	day	care,	even	a	resistant	one.

## CHAPTER	13

## Behavior	vs.	Potty	Training

T his	 is	 probably	 the	 trickiest	 issue	 I	 address	 in	 this	 book-separating	 out behavior	from	potty	training.	There	is	a	lot	for	your	child	to	learn	when	potty training.	Certainly	the	first	few	days,	and	maybe	even	the	first	few	weeks,	are full	 of	 learning.	 Learning,	 by	 nature,	 requires	 making	 some	 mistakes	 and/or having	 some	 accidents.	 However,	 there	 is	 a	 difference	 between	 learning	 and behavior.	When	your	child	is	showing	behavior-and	I	mean	of	the	bad	variety -the	behavior	must	be	addressed.

First,	I	need	to	cover	some	ground	about	boundaries	and	limits,	then	I'll	hit specific	behaviors	I've	seen	in	potty	training.	Boundaries	and	limits	have	a	bad rap	in	parenting	of	late.	They	can	seem	mean	or	draconian	or	too	authoritarian. Many	parents	 don't	 believe	 in	 any	 sort	 of	 consequence	 or	 discipline.	 Let	 me state	outright:	I	do	not	recommend	nor	do	I	believe	in	hitting	a	child.	Ever.

Chances	 are	 you	 are	 potty	 training	 somewhere	 around	 the	 two-year	 mark, and	around	the	same	time,	you	may	see	some	other	two-year-old	behavior.	This may	well	be	the	very	first	time	you	are	seeing	your	child	act	up,	but	it's	normal. The	terrible	 twos	 (and	 even	 threes)	 aren't	 just	 a	 cliché;	 they	 are	 real.	 In	 the course	of	normal	development,	your	child must test	limits.	It's	his	job.	He	needs to	find	out	where	the	fence	is,	so	to	speak.	The	reason	you	physically	fence	in your	yard	is	so	your	child	can't	wander	and	get	lost.	Limits	and	boundaries	are the	 fence	 in	 your	 child's	 psyche.	 With	 them	 intact,	 just	 as	 in	 your	 yard,	 your child	feels	safe	and	secure	knowing	where	he	can	and	can't	go.

A	 trend	 in	 modern	 parenting	 is	 to	 assume	 that	 the	 child	 is	 capable	 of deciding	 good	 things	 for	 himself	 without	 being	 provided	 any	 boundaries	 or limits.	 This	 is	 just	 not	 the	 case.	 I	 often	 look	 to	 the	 Montessori	 system	 for examples	 of	 how	 to	 allow	 children	 to	 make	 decisions	 while	 also	 providing boundaries.	Within	a	certain	framework,	the	children	are	free	to	make	choices, but	they	are	not	free	to	do	whatever	it	is	they	want.	Johnny	might	prefer	Tinker Toys	to	Lincoln	Logs;	that's	his	 freedom	 within	 that	 play	 center.	 But	 Johnny isn't	allowed	to	wander	aimlessly	through	all	the	toys.	The	children	all	eat	lunch together.	 You	 can't	 have	 a	 bunch	 of	 kids	 with	 access	 to	 the	 snack	 fridge	 and leave	it	up	to	them	to	decide	when	they	are	hungry-you	would	have	mayhem. The	children	all	go	outside	together,	whether	one	is	tired	or	not.	Our	children require	some	fences.	Within	those	fences	we	can	allow	for	tremendous	freedom.

Bringing	Up	Bébé by	Pamela	Druckerman	was	released	to	a	torrent	of	mixed press.	Ms.	Druckerman	claims	that	the	French,	in	general,	are	doing	a	better	job of	parenting	than	Americans	are,	largely	because	of	the	French	notion	of cadre . Cadre ,	loosely	translated,	means	'framework.'	French	children	are	given	a	strict framework,	 but	 within	 that	 they	 have	 tremendous	 freedom.	 There	 is	 much	 I don't like in the	 book-or	 rather	 there's	 much	 about	 what	 the	 French supposedly	do	and	don't	do	that	I	dislike-but	I	agree	fully	with cadre .

What	I	see,	both	in	my	life	and	in	my	work,	is	that	a	lot	of	us	parents	struggle with	providing	freedom	within	boundaries.	In	our	quest	to	raise	free-thinking, independent	children	we	are	not	providing	enough	of	a	framework	for	them	to feel	safe.

I've	mentioned Simplicity	Parenting by	Kim	John	Payne	a	couple	of	times.	Mr. Payne	was	a	Waldorf	teacher	and	is	so	brilliant	and	eloquent	on	this	topic,	I can't	recommend	this	book	highly	enough.	He	says	that	raising	children	is	like building	 a	 pyramid.	 The	 widest	 part	 at	 the	 bottom	 is	 the	 foundation.	 That	 is made	up	of	'governing,'	and	takes	place	roughly	from	birth	to	age	six.	Next	is the	middle	of	the	pyramid,	made	up	of	a	'gardening'	phase	that	takes	place	from roughly	six	to	twelve	years.	And	last,	at	the	top,	is	the	'guiding'	phase,	which	is the	way	he	recommends	parenting	children	ages	twelve	to	eighteen.	He	suggests that	most	parents	have	flipped	the	pyramid	and	are	trying	to	guide	our	children when	 they	 need	 governing.	 By	 govern,	 he	 means	 providing	 boundaries	 and limits,	 not	 cruel	 or	 harsh	 punishment.	 When	 a	 parent	 tries	 to	 guide	 a	 child whose	frontal	 lobes-the	 area	 of	 the	 brain	 responsible	 for	 logic	 and	 reasonisn't	fully	formed,	it	backfires.	Then	that	parent	is	left	to	govern	when	the	child is	older	and	should	only	need	guiding.	Now,	from	own	personal	experience,	I	see this	in	my	own	community.	I	see	children	raised	with	no	limits	or	boundaries who,	by	the	time	they	are	five	or	six,	are	wild	and	very	hard	to	control.	By	this,	I mean	 that	 they	 exhibit	 out-of-control	 behavior,	 not	 that	 they	 should	 be 'controllable'	like	a	puppet.

Payne	 also	 uses	 the	 analogy	 of	 you,	 the	 parent,	 driving	 a	 car.	 Imagine	 the anxiety	your	child	would	feel	if	you	were	driving,	they	were	in	the	backseat,	and you	had	no	idea	where	you	were	going.	I've	extrapolated	that	idea	even	further. Imagine	if	your	child	were responsible	for	 giving	 you	 the	 directions ,	 and	 that	 you just	followed	their	directions.	Go	left.	Go	straight.	No.	Left.	Wow.	You'd	soon be	 lost,	 yes?	 That's	 where	 things	 can	 get	 mucky	 with	 the	 oft-touted	 child-led model	of	parenting.	You	can	be	child-led	in	that	you	listen	to	and	validate	your child,	but	you	simply	cannot	follow	your	child's	lead	through	life.	You	both	will get	lost.	The	car	you	are	driving	is	life,	and	it's	your	job	to	know	where	you	are going.	Ironically,	many	of	the	parents	I've	worked	with	and	have	known	in	my personal	life	are	striving	to	give	their	child	a	'free'	childhood.	Still,	how	free	is your	child	if	he	is	fully	responsible	for	the	direction	the	car	is	traveling?	It's	very anxiety	provoking.	A	truly	free	childhood	should	be	about	chocolate	or	vanilla, and	little	else.

All	 this	 is	 particularly	 true	 if	 you	 have	 a	 spirited	 or	 strong-willed	 child.	 I often	work	with	parents	who	have	a	child	fitting	this	description.	This	child	is usually	challenging	in	general	and	will	be	challenging	when	it	comes	to	potty training	as	well.	Still,	this	child	needs	boundaries	and	limits	just	as	much	as,	if not	more	than,	your	garden-variety	kid.

All	well	and	good,	Jamie,	but	what	does	this	have	to	do	with	potty	training?

Well,	sometimes	behavior	kicks	up	during	potty	training.	And	because	potty training	 is	 so	 wrought	 with	 emotion,	 it	 becomes	 hard	 to	 pull	 it	 apart	 from behavior.	I	also	find	that	parents	will	put	up	with	all	kinds	of	behavior	during potty	training	that	they	wouldn't	in	other	circumstances.

For	 example,	 one	 of	 the	 biggest	 challenges	 parents	 today	 face	 during	 potty training	is	getting	their	child	to	sit	on	the	potty.	Yes,	you	can	read	to	them	or sing	to	them.	I	say	it's	okay	to	play	with	a	mobile	device	as	a	distraction	in	the very	beginning.	But	really,	when	you	ask	your	child	to	sit	to	go	potty,	your	child should	sit.	Now,	to	a	lot	of	people	that	sounds	harsh.	But	if	you	take	it	out	of	the context	of	potty	training,	it	sounds	perfectly	reasonable.	Say	it's	time	to	sit	down for	dinner,	and	your	child	keeps	bouncing	up	(assuming	they	aren't	buckled	to	a chair	 of	 sorts).	 You	 tell	 your	 child	 to	 sit	 and	 they	 don't.	 How	 do	 you	 handle that?

I'm	 asking	 because-whatever	 your	 response-that's	 how	 you're	 going	 to handle	it	during	potty	training.	When	it's	dinner	time,	it's	time	to	sit	and	eat. When	it's	potty	time,	it's	time	to	sit	on	the	potty.	Same	thing.

Whenever	you	encounter	behavior	during	potty	training,	do	your	best	to	put it	into	a	different	context.	That	will	help	you	figure	out	how	best	to	handle	it	in the	context	of	potty	training.	It's	totally	your	parenting	call.	I	do	not	nor	have	I ever	felt	comfortable	telling	people	how	to	handle	behavior	in	general.	That's why	I'm	giving	you	a	framework	to	work	within,	and	you	can	make	your	own parenting	decisions.

Many	parents	say,	'I	don't	feel	comfortable	making	him	sit.'	I	agree.	I	don't think	you	should	force	your	child	to	sit.	However,	it's	worth	pondering	just	how fearful	we've	become	of	transition	to	the	potty.	Many	parents	fear	doing anything negative	around	potty	training.	Using	a	firm	or	stern	voice	sounds	negative	to these	parents,	and	they're	concerned	about	traumatizing	the	child.	This	is	where another	scenario	comes	in	handy.	Every	single	one	of	us	has	held	our	child	down and	strapped	them	into	the	car	seat.	Even	when	they	are	kicking,	screaming, and	hitting.	We	do	it	because	we	must	go	somewhere	and	we	need	them	to	be safe.	 Has	your	child	ever	been	traumatized	by	that	and	never	wanted	to	sit	in the	car	seat	again?	I'm	guessing	no.	Again,	I'm	not	saying	you	should	force	your child	onto	the	potty	or	strap	him	down,	or	anything	remotely	like	that.	I'm	just pointing	out	that	this	fear	of	traumatizing	a	child	by	conveying	the	message	that you	mean	business	has	gotten	a	little	bit	out	of	control.

Another	 thing	 to	 keep	 in	 mind	 is	 the	 difference	 between	 'the	 child	 you have'	and	'the	child	you	want.'	You	have	the	kid	you	have,	not	necessarily	the kid	you	want.	This	is	especially	true	when	potty	training.

I	can	give	you	suggestions	about	any	special	circumstances	you	may	have,	but we	cannot	change	your	zebra's	stripes.	Still,	this	is	hard	for	us	to	admit	and	hard to	 remember.	 We	all	 want	 the	 well-behaved,	 loving,	 courteous	 child.	 We	 got what	we	got.	Still,	our	love	is	fierce.	While	you	are	potty	training,	be	careful	not to	linger	in	the	land	of	'I	wish	he	.	.	.'	We	can	deal	with	what	we	have,	but	we cannot	deal	with	a	fantasy.	Your	kid	comes	with	all	his	own	crazy,	his	own	stuff, his	own	DNA.

There's	another	aspect	to	'the	kid	you	have.'	If	your	child	has	a	particular 'problem'-say	 he's	 whiny,	 or	 she's	 resistant	 or	 prone	 to	 histrionics	 and tantrums-you	are	going	to	have	this	same	kid	when	you	are	potty	training.	No judgment;	 there	 is	 no	 behavior	 I	 have	 not	 seen.	 Still,	 I	 see	 parents	 who somehow	think	potty	training	is	going	to	happen	in	a	bubble-that	all	the	other behavior	the	child	exhibits	is	somehow	not	going	to	appear	while	potty	training. This	is	a	big	transition,	so	these	behaviors	will	not	only	be	there,	but	they	might even	get	magnified	for	a	short	period	of	time.

Again,	it's	all	good.	Just	keep	your	expectations	level	and	your	love	big. I've	worked	with	many	parents	who	forget	'the	child	they	have'	and	really have	an	expectation	that	I	can	fix	intrinsic	behavior.	I	worked	with	a	client, Denise,	 whose	 daughter	 Sienna	 was	 very	 strong-willed.	 After	 many,	 many conversations,	Denise	went	off	on	me.	She	told	me	that	she	was	not	impressed with	me	or	my	method.	She	said	I	had	claimed	I	could	deal	with	'this	behavior.'

I	cannot	fix	your	child's	general	behavior.	That's	up	to	you.

Whatever	you	child's	personality	is,	I	can't	change	that	or	fix	it;	that's	built in.	If	your	child	is	exhibiting	behavior	you	don't	like	or	you	feel	is	disrespectful, you	will	most	likely	see	that	very	same	behavior	while	potty	training.	What	I can tell	you	is	how	to	deal	with	some	of	the	behaviors	you	find	in	potty	training.

Here's	a	clear	example	of	behavior.	Say	your	child	did	great	for	a	few	days. Suddenly,	 she	 doesn't	 want	 to	 use	 the	 potty	 anymore.	 This	 can	 look	 like	 a defiant	'NO!'	or	it	can	look	like	she	just	can't	be	bothered	with	it.	If	she	sat	and peed/pooped	on	the	potty	more	than	one	time,	then	we	know	she	can	do	it. Period.	It's	that	simple.	If	she	subsequently	chooses	not	to,	it's	behavior.

If	 you're	 not	 sure	 whether	 or	 not	 you're	 dealing	 with	 behavior,	 look	 inside and	see	how	you're	feeling.	If	you	are	feeling	sad	or	a	little	heartbroken	that	this isn't	going	as	you	intended,	chances	are	your	child	needs	more	learning.	If	you feel	like	you	are	being	played,	if	you	feel	angry,	or	if	you	feel	like	strangling	your kid,	I'll	bet	it's	behavior.	Most	times,	parents	have	a	really	good	sense	when	they are	 dealing	 with	 behavior	 but	 don't	 do	 anything	 because	 they	 are	 terrified	 of 'traumatizing'	the	child.	Having	boundaries	and	following	through	is	not	going to	traumatize	your	child	in	any	sense.

When	you	have	a	kid	who	you	know	is	playing	you,	the	absolute	best	thing	to do	is	give	a	small,	immediate,	appropriate	consequence.	For	instance,	take	away the	 toy	 he	 was	 playing	 with	 when	 he	 wet	 his	 pants,	 or	 take	 him	 out	 of	 the activity	 in	 which	 he	 was	 engaged.	 Time-outs	 are	 usually	 not	 effective	 for 'accidents,'	nor	are	longer-term	things	like	saying	he	can't	go	to	swim	or	dance class.	If	he	has	an	accident	in	the	morning,	it	doesn't	work	to	threaten	to	take away	 dessert	 after	 dinner.	 Toddlers	 just	 don't	 have	 that	 extended	 a	 thought process.	This	is	why	sticker	charts	are	useless.	Toddlers	don't	have	the	thought process	 to	 say,	 'Wow.	 I	 have	 six	 stickers;	 one	 more	 and	 I'll	 have	 a	 week	 of staying	dry!'

The	 small,	 immediate	 consequence	 is	 also	 helpful	 when	 you	 aren't	 sure whether	he	needs	more	learning	or	is	exhibiting	behavior.	I	think	I've	made	it clear that	 pride	 and	 self-mastery	 should	 be	 the	 motivation	 behind	 potty training.	However,	for	some	children	that	never	clicks	in,	and	they	need	some external	motivation	to	nudge	things	along.	Some	parents	react	along	the	lines of,	 'But	 I'll	 feel	 terrible	 if	 I	 give	 him	 a	 consequence	 and	 he	 needs	 more learning.'	Taking	away	a	small	toy	as	a	consequence	is	not	going	to	scar	your child	for	life.	And	it's	really	the	fastest	way	to	get	an	answer.	If	your	child	can't use	 the	 potty	 knowing	 that	 his	 Thomas	 the	 Tank	 Engine	 will	 get	 put	 on	 the fridge	for	an	hour	if	he	doesn't,	you	can	bet	your	butt	he	needs	more	learning. And	he	won't	be	scarred.	If	you	child can do	it,	then	you	know	the	accidents	are due	 to	 behavior.	 I'm	 interested	 in	 real-world	 potty	 training,	 not	 theory. Consequences	will	get	you	your	answer	the	fastest.

Some	 parents	 say,	 'Isn't	 a	 consequence	 just	 the	 opposite	 of	 a	 reward?	 I'd rather	 reward	 the	 behavior	 I	 want	 rather	 than	 give	 a	 consequence	 for	 what	 I

don't	want.'	I	understand	the	theory	behind	this	and,	yes,	in	general,	positive reinforcement	works	best	with	children.	However,	we	go	back	to	that	notion	of expected	behavior .	The	problem	with	rewards	and	potty	training	is	that	they	get sticky.	The	stakes	need	to	be	raised	constantly	in	order	for	them	to	be	effective. If	you	are	going	to	reward	for	peeing,	where	else	will	that	lead?	This,	of	course,	is your	 parenting	 call.	 Personally,	 I	 would	 rather	 curb	 undesired	 behavior	 than reward	the	hell	out	of	good	behavior.	Else,	you	end	up	with	a	kid	who	expects	to be	rewarded	for	everything.

Though	I	 homeschool	 now,	 my	 son	 did	 go	 to	 school	 for	 kindergarten	 and part	 of	 first	 grade.	 His	 school	 has	 a	 system	 of	 rewards,	 called	 Kennedy	 Kash. Basically,	when	you	are	'good,'	you	get	a	Kennedy	Kash,	which	you	collect	and can	 use	 to	 'buy'	 something	 at	 the	 school	 store.	 This	 is	 all	 based	 on	 positive reinforcement,	you	follow?	If	you	are	'bad,'	you	don't	get	a	consequence,	they just	amp	up	everyone	else's	Kennedy	Kash.	So	now,	my	son	gets	this	Kennedy Kash	for	breathing	or	paying	attention.	And	the	kids	who	are	misbehaving	have stopped	caring	about	the	damn	Kennedy	Kash	and	still	misbehave.	It's	a	total disaster	 of	 a	 social	 experiment.	 I	 don't	 want	 my	 child	 getting	 rewards	 for breathing.	Or	paying	attention.	That's	what	I	mean	when	I	say	that	the	stakes have	to	be	raised	constantly	in	order	for	a	reward	to	be	effective.	You	have	to keep	amping	up	the	rewards.	So	no;	a	consequence	is	not	just	the	opposite	of	a reward.	I	fully	believe	in	rewards	for	exemplary	behavior,	and	I	also	believe	that bad	behavior	gets	a	consequence.

I add	 that	 I	 think	 you	 should	 differentiate	 between	 the	 child	 and	 the behavior.	Your child is	good	and	always	will	be.	Her behavior is/can	be	bad.	This is	very	important.

Moving	 on.	 If	 you	 are	 getting overtly defiant	 behavior-like	 your	 child	 is looking	you	in	the	eyes	and	peeing	on	your	carpet-this	is	different	and	is	very serious.	 I	 discuss	 this	 further	 in	 chapter	 15,	 'Younger	 Than	 Twenty	 Months, Older	Than	Three	Years.'	Generally,	this	sort	of	defiance	is	found	in	kids	older than	 three.	 Bottom	 line,	 it	 warrants	 serious	 help	 right	 now,	 because	 it	 is	 not about	potty	training-it	is	about	anger.	Deep	anger.	I	highly	suggest	you	contact a	family	therapist	as	soon	as	possible.	Otherwise,	it	will	only	get	worse	and	could escalate	into	potentially	dangerous	behavior.

Of	course,	once	again, you know	your	child	best.	I	just	adore	this	letter	from	a mom:

So	I	modified	your	method	a	little	(okay	maybe	a	lot)	because	I	know	my	son and	we	would	have	ended	up	with	a	fridge	full	of	toys.	I	took	the	basic	concept of	what	you	said	and	did	the	'WHEN	you	do	THIS	I	will	do	THAT.'	I	said, matter	of	fact,	'Let's	go	try	to	go	pee-pee	on	the	toilet'	and	took	his	hand	and	he said,	'Okay,	Mommy.'

We	walked	to	the	bathroom,	and	I	closed	the	door	behind	us	and	suggested we	read	a	book.	He	said	no	and	would	not	sit	on	his	potty.	So	I	said,	'When you	pee-pee	in	the	potty,	we	can	go	back	to	playing.'	When	he	realized	we	were going to be in the bathroom	 until he peed he SCREAMED	 for	 every toy/video/treat	he	could	think	of.

As	he	named	each	one,	I	said	calmly,	'When	you	pee-pee	in	the	toilet,	we can	[play	with	this	or	have	that].'	We	went	through	the	list	one	by	one	as	he brought	up	each	toy,	and	this	lasted	for	almost	forty	minutes.	I	read	one	of	his books	off	to	the	side	(trying	to	seem	uninterested	in	whether	he	went	or	not)	and suddenly,	he	sat	down	and	peed	on	the	toilet!	An	hour	later,	he	did	the	potty dance	and	we	went	back	to	the	bathroom	again	and	had	WAY	less	drama	this time,	I'd	say	it	took	less	than	ten	minutes,	and	he	didn't	sit	this	time:	he	stood up	and	peed	in	his	toilet!	This	morning	was	the	same	thing;	I	took	him	to	the bathroom,	closed	the	door,	and	it	took	maybe	five	minutes	before	he	peed	in	the toilet.

At	day	care,	when	we	first	arrived,	I	walked	him	straight	into	the	bathroom that	 is	 attached	 to	 his	 room.	 He	 smiled	 and	 happily	 pointed	 at	 everything	 and named	it,	'Toilet,	sink,	soap,'	and	I	said,	'Yes,	this	is	where	you	will	pee-pee today,	and	this	is	where	you	will	wash	your	hands,'	etc.	.	.	.

We	tried	to	go	pee-pee,	but	he	didn't	go	and	I	told	him	that	was	okay;	we could	 try	 later.	 I	 followed	 your	 advice,	 didn't	 mention	 what	 a	 disaster	 it	 has been,	and	just	told	them	that	he	does	not	say	when	he	needs	to	go	every	time	so it's	best	if	you	put	him	in	front	of	the	toilet	about	every	hour.	When	the	teacher took	 him	 in	 there	 the	 first	 time,	 he	 didn't	 pee	 until	 they	 stepped	 out	 of	 the bathroom,	so	he	had	an	accident	in	his	pants.	But	after	that	he	peed	in	the	toilet every	time	today!!!!!!!

I	feel	like	we	turned	a	corner	last	night,	and	I	know	we	have	a	ways	to	go until	he	learns	to	tell	us	before	it's	time,	but	I	feel	a	huge	weight	has	been	lifted off	my	shoulders.	THANK	YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!'

What	I	love	about	this	mom	is	that	she	knew	her	kid	really	well.	And	while	she took	my	general	advice,	she	knew	how	to	tweak	it	to	make	it	work	for	her	son. She	knew	he	was	being	stubborn	and	she	took	it	as	a	challenge-a	good	kind	of challenge-and	she	was right! Once	over	that	barrier	of	behavior,	she	was	met with	consistent	success.

As	 I	 said,	 this	 is	 a	 tricky	 chapter.	 I'm	 an	 overthinking,	 overeducated, overparenter,	as	are	most	of	my	friends	and	clients.	I	know	I've	probably	stated some	 things	 that	 have	 pushed	 your	 buttons.	 That's	 okay.	 This	 is	 how	 it	 all makes	 sense	 in	 my	 head	 as	 a	 mom	 and	 in	 my	 work	 as	 a	 potty	 trainer.	 If something	doesn't	fully	resonate,	think	about	it,	run	it	through	a	sieve	in	your mind,	keep	what	makes	sense	to	you,	and	ditch	what	doesn't.	Most	of	what	I've addressed	 here	 has	 to	 do	 with	 'parenting	 philosophy.'	 My	 personal	 parenting technique	is	not	to	be	tied	to	any	one	school	of	thought.	Just	as	I	suggest	you	do, I	 filter	 through	 things	 and	 keep	 what	 makes	 sense	 and	 ditch	 what	 doesn't.	 If your	philosophy	is	no	longer	working	for	you,	you	can	start	to	change	things.	I like	to	think	of	what	I'm	teaching	in	terms	of	whether	it	will	work	for	the	long haul.	I'm	not	just	raising	a	son;	I'm	raising	a	future	man,	partner,	and	member	of the	community.

## CHAPTER	14

## Elimination	Communication

T his	chapter	is	for	you	if	you've	used	Elimination	Communication	(EC)	in	any form.	Elimination	Communication	is	the	practice	of	using	your	child's	cues	to help	them	eliminate	their	waste.	For	some,	it	looks	like	no	diaper	use,	ever.	For others,	it's	a	combination	of	using	diapers	and	not.	It	doesn't	really	matter	how long	you've	ECed	or	how	consistently.	I	want	to	personally	say	thank	you	for saving	us	all x amount	of	landfill	space!	I	have	worked	with	many	EC	experts over	 the	 years,	 and	 I	 will	 share	 everything	 I	 know	 about	 getting	 from	 EC	 to potty	trained.	Some	of	what	I	have	to	say	is	probably	going	to	raise	your	ire	at first.	 I	 ask	 you	 to	 please	 read	 and	 absorb	 with	 an	 open	 mind.	 I've	 worked extensively	with	ECers,	and	this	is	what	I've	found	to	be	true.	I	have	no	interest in	arguing.	My	only	interest	is	getting	your	child	to	pee	and	poop	on	the	potty. I'm	going	to	hit	the	main	points	I've	personally	run	into	with	clients.	If	some	of this	doesn't	apply,	just	disregard.

Most	 of	 my	 former	 ECers	 come	 to	 me	 when	 their	 kids	 are	 somewhere between	sixteen	and	twenty-four	months.	I've	heard	of	some	EC	kids	who	are not	 yet	 potty	 trained	 at	 thirty-six	 months	 and	 beyond.	 I'm	 not	 sure	 what	 to think	about	that.

Now,	you're	 reading	 this,	 which	 means	 regardless	 of	 current	 EC	 literature, you	 know	 in	 your	 heart	 it's	 time	 for	 completion.	 I'm	 going	 to	 call	 this completion	process	a	'bridge,'	for	brevity;	a	bridge	from	there	to	here.

I	 contacted	 some	 EC	 experts	 because	 I	 was	 getting	 more	 and	 more	 clients who	wanted	to	potty	train	before	twenty	months.	I	fully	support	this	but	found myself	 'warning'	 people	 this	 would	 be	 a	 certain	 percentage	 of	 ECing	 and	 a certain	percentage	of	PTing.	But	then	I	realized,	holy	crap,	I'd heard of	EC,	but	I certainly	didn't	know	all	the	ins	and	outs.	Of	course,	I	think	it's	brilliant	to	have avoided	as	many	diapers	as	possible	in	your	child's	life.	However,	there	are	some things	that	are	part	of	EC	that	will	make	PTing	a	bit	difficult.

- 1.	Diaper-free	Time.
- 2.	Catching	the	pee,	not	moving	physically	to	the	potty.
- 3.	Philosophy.
- 4.	The	idea	that	your	child	will	just	potty	train	themselves.
- 5.	The	expectation	that	EC	gives	you	a	jump	on	PTing.
- 6.	Potty	strike.

## Diaper-free	Time

I	don't	know	the	particulars	about	your	situation	but	for	many	parents,	Diaperfree	 Time	 gets	 misconstrued.	 For	 many,	 Diaper-free	 Time	 has	 most	 likely conditioned	your	child	to	pee	on	the	floor.	I	have	heard	many	stories	of	children who	simply	stay	naked	all	day	with	parents	attempting	catches	but	really	just cleaning	 up	 a	 lot	 of	 pee.	 I	 talked	 to	 many	 EC	 experts	 through	 the	 years.	 I couldn't	wrap	my	head	around	this	particular	practice.	Apparently	this	is	used	to teach	cause	and	effect,	which	is	an	okay	theory	but	not	that	great	in	reality.	I remember	when	I	was	pregnant	reading	a	brilliant	article	about	toddlers.	The gist	 was	 that	 toddlers	 aren't	 really	 out	 to	 bug	 the	 hell	 out	 of	 you	 or	 kill themselves. There's just so much	 to	 discover	 that every moment	 is	 an experiment	and	discovery.	So	when	they	pour	their	milk	out	onto	the	floor,	it's for	the	joy	of	seeing,	'Oh	.	.	. this happens	when	I	do that .	Cool.'	And,	yes,	that is	 cause	 and	 effect.	 However,	 it's	 our	 job	 as	 parents	 to	 let	 them	 know	 that pouring	 milk	 out	 onto	 the	 floor	 is	 not	 acceptable.	 While	 we	 wouldn't	 yell	 or shame	them,	we	would	consistently	probably	frown	and	say	something	akin	to, 'No,	no	.	.	.	no	milk	stays	on	the	table.'	Right?

So,	now	let's	look	at	the	cause	and	effect	of	peeing	anywhere,	anytime	the urge	hits.	If	you	never	let	on	that	it's	unacceptable	.	.	.	then	it's	acceptable.	It's therefore	 learned	 behavior	 to	 just	 pee	 where	 you	 need	 to	 pee.	 This	 might	 be okay	in	the	early	days,	regardless	of	what	age	you	started	ECing,	but	once	your child	consistently	does	this	for	any	big	chunk	of	time,	it's	sort	of	cemented	in.	In other	words,	you've	traded	in	a	diaper	for	your	floor.

The	only	reason	I	bring	up	Diaper-free	Time	is	because	the	very	first	thing	I hear	from	an	EC	Mama	is	resistance	to	a	naked	day.	When	I	first	met	Jean,	the first	 thing	 out	 of	 her	 mouth	 was	 a	 kind	 of	 angry,	 'I	 do not see	 the	 point	 in	 a naked	day.	I	have	done	months	of	naked	days,	and	all	I	do	is	clean	up	pee.'	I still	have	to	ask	you	to	do	the	naked	day.	The	naked	day	is	vitally	important	to one	of	the	biggest	steps	in	building	the	bridge	from	EC	to	PT,	which	brings	us	to issue	number	two.

## Catching	the	Pee,	not	Moving	Physically	to	the	Potty

Thus	far	in	EC,	you	probably	have	an	amazing	bond	with	your	child.	You	know her	signals	and	you	rush	to	potty	her,	mostly	where	it's	convenient.	I love the fact	 that	 EC	 gives	 you	 'permission'	 to	 potty	 anywhere.	 However,	 once	 you officially	 start	 potty	 training,	 you	 do	 want	 to	 get	 your	 child	 to	 the	 potty	 of choice	(either	the	little	potty	or	the	insert	on	the	toilet).	The	big	thing	here	is getting	the	child	physically	to	the	proper	place.	Every	potty	training	mom	has had	to	get	her	creative	pee	catching	groove	on	in	a	tight	spot.	But	the	norm	has to	be	getting	the	child	to	the	potty.	I'd	say	this	step	alone	is	the	biggest	in	the bridge	from	there	to	here.

## Philosophy

I	know	that	'traditional	potty	training'	is	a	dirty	phrase	in	EC.	I	know	there	are 'boot	camps'	for	potty	training	and	all	kinds	of	coercive	methods	or	advice.	I hope	 that	 by	 now	 you	 realize	 I'm	 very	 prochild	 and	 feel	 very	 protective	 of children.	However,	at	certain	times	I	find	myself	having	to	remind	parents	that it's	 okay	 to	 have	 boundaries	 and	 expectations.	 There's	 a	 lot	 of	 philosophy around	EC	and	attachment	parenting	that	sometimes	falls	apart	as	your	child nears	the	twos.	I	don't	think	the	twos	need	to	be	terrible	by	any	stretch,	but	you may	find	 that	 some	 of	 this	 EC-associated	 philosophy	 doesn't	 hold	 up.	 I	 don't want	to	argue	this	point,	and	I'm	not	saying	anything	about	anyone's	parenting style.	 I	 simply	 find	 this	 is	 a	 hard	 place	 in	 parenting	 to	 maintain	 theory.	 Your child	will	begin	limit	testing,	and	his	favorite	word	will	likely	be	'No.'

A	lot	of	the	philosophy	out	there	suggests	that	there	can	be	nothing	negative around	the	potty.	Much	as	in	the	'milk	on	the	floor'	cause-and-effect	example, you	do	have	to	tell	your	child	what	your	positive	expectation	is	and	what	the negative	expectation	is.	This	does	not	have	to	sound	mean,	but	you	do	need	to mean	business.	At	some	point	your	child	must	learn	that	peeing	just	anywhere	is a	'don't.'	What	I	find	is	a	lot	of	parents	emphasize	the	positive	end	of	things ('only	 pee	 in	 the	 potty'),	 but	 they	 leave	 out	 the	 other	 part	 of	 the	 equation ('don't	pee	anywhere	else').	So,	yes,	you	definitely	want	to	stress	the	positive, but	make	sure	you	are	being	clear	about	what	you don't want	as	well.

## The	Idea	That	Your	Child	Will	Just	Potty	Train	Himself

Once	in	a	while	a	child	will	decide	to	potty	himself.	Usually	this	is	not	the	case, however,	which	makes	sense	if	you	think	about	it.	And	that's	probably	why	you are	 here.	 Peeing	 and	 pooping	 are	 primal	 behaviors,	 right?	 You	 don't	 have	 to teach	 a	 kid	 how	 to	 pee	 or	 poop.	 Putting	 it	 in	 a container of	 some	 sort	 is	 a socialized	behavior.	Socialized	behavior	must	be	taught.	If	I	want	something	you are	holding,	the	most	effective	way	to	get	it	is	to	slap	it	out	of	your	hand.	That	is primal.	The	socialized	way	of	getting	it	is	to	ask	or	negotiate. That is	what	must be	taught.

How	do	we	teach	that?	When	our	children	use	the	primal	instinct	to	slap something	out	of	someone's	hand,	we	look	them	in	the	eyes,	we	say	in	a	pretty stern	voice,	'No	hitting.	You	ask.'	We	probably	frown	or	make	a	disapproving facial	expression.	We	are	more	effective	when	we	use	simple	language. No this, Yes that.	There	doesn't	need	to	be	a	ton	of	talking	about	it.	I	think	all	of	us,	as	a whole,	are	doing	way	too	much	talking.	I	especially	think	this	is	true	in	potty training.	It's	similar	to	your	child	learning	the	ABCs.	They	aren't	learning	all the	 power	 behind	 the	 letters	 that	 make	 different	 sounds	 at	 different	 times	 in millions	of	combinations.	They	just	like	the	song.	In	potty	training,	the	short, more	direct	words	work	best.

## The	Expectation	That	EC	Gives	You	a	Jump	on	PTing

Now	the	 hardest	 part,	 I	 think,	 about	 bridging	 EC	 to	 PT	 is	 dealing	 with	 the expectation	that	because	you've	been	working	at	it	for	a	fairly	long	time,	this should	be	easy	for	your	child.	Believe	me.	I	think	this	should	be	true	as	well.	I don't	want	you	to	be	mad	at	me,	but	I've	found	that	this	isn't	necessarily	the case.	It's	a	real	freaking	bummer.	You	have	worked	hard	and	deserve	a	jump	on potty	training.	And	the	fact	that	you're	probably	not	going	to	get	one	is	really hard	to	wrap	your	head	around.	What	I have found	is	that	once	you're	over	the hump,	 ECed	 kids	 tend	 to	 move	 much	 faster	 and	 the	 training	 'sticks'	 much better.	 And	you	have	the	bonus	of	not	only	a	great	bond	but	also	of knowing your	child's	signals.

What	I've	found	works	best	for	ECers	who	want	to	potty	train	is	to	simply think	of	this	as	another	(separate)	process.	Your	child	probably	hasn't	made	the connection	 that	 she	 is	 the	 one	 who	 should	 be	 in	 action	 once	 the	 feeling	 of having	to	pee	strikes.	And	your	child	is	probably	very	used	to	peeing	as	the	urge hits,	wherever	that	may	be.	These	two	little	connections	are	the	biggest.

Making	these	connections	is	not	hard	physically.	This	is	a	turnaround	in	your head.	It's	the	slightest	adjustment	that	will	make	this	so	much	easier.	When	I

met	Gwen	I	think	we	went	around	her	philosophy	for	days.	She	didn't	want	to say	 anything	negative	about	the	potty.	She	didn't	want	to	do	naked	day.	She really	thought	her	twenty-two-month-old	daughter	would,	any	day,	turn	around and	 potty	 herself.	 I	 pointed	 out	 that	 Gwen	 had	 come	 to	 me,	 so	 clearly	 she thought	she	needed	help	in	her	daughter's	completion.	She	did,	indeed	.	.	.	but she	had	such	a	hard	time,	thinking	all	her	work	of	ECing	was	going	to	waste.

In	fact,	she	was	pissed	at	EC.	If	a	child	can	be	potty	trained	in	under	a	week, why'd	she	waste	all	this	time	trying	to	help	her	child	connect	the	dots	with	EC? Maybe	you're	feeling	something	similar.	I	know	a	lot	of	people	do.	I	encouraged Gwen	to	think	of	all	the	positives.	Not	clogging	the	planet	with	crappy	diapers, having	an	incredible	bond	with	her	daughter.	Mostly,	the	greatest	thing	is	that she	already	knew	her	daughter's	signals.	This	is	incredibly	hard	for	some	moms who've	diapered	to	figure	out.	They	haven't	'kept	track,'	so	to	speak,	and	they are	 starting	 from	 ground	 zero.	 From	 diaper	 moms	 I	 almost	 always	 hear,	 'She didn't	show	any	sign	she	was	going	to	pee.'	Now,	you,	as	an	ECer,	know	better. So	you	do	have	some	advantages.

Another	pitfall	is	when	your	child	is	taking	longer	than	average.	I	had	one former	client,	Jill,	who	flipped	her	lid.	On	'my	clock'	she	was	on	her	fourth	day of	 potty	 training.	 But	 because	she	had	basically	done	Diaper-free	Time	for	six months,	she	felt	like	she'd	been	potty	training	for	six	months	and	four	days.	So it	was	very	frustrating	to	her.	She	kept	yelling,	'I've	been	at	this	for	months!!! When	is	it	going	to	be	over???'	And	I	kept	saying,	'We're	on	the	fourth	day	of potty	training!'	We	had	to	really	look	at	it	like	EC	was	wonderful	and	then	it stopped,	and	then	potty	training	began,	and	it	was	its	own	process.	Once	she made	peace	with	this,	it	eased	everything	up	for	her.

## Potty	Strike

A	 lot	 of	 moms	 write	 in	 that	 at	 some	 point	 their	 child	 started	 arching	 and resisting	 the	 process.	 I	 actually	 think that is	 the	 signal	 to	 start	 in	 with	 potty training.	In	PT,	almost	all	resistance	is	caused	by	us	being	too	focused	on	the process.	By	hovering	and	overprompting.	I	really	think	this	is	the	reason	for	the resistance	in	EC.	You	have	been	catching	pee	for	a	long	time,	and	it's	all	you	are probably	thinking	about.	All	my	ECers	come	to	me	with	pee	logs.	Ditch	them. You	don't	need	a	pee	log.	You	know	your	child.	I	really	do	believe	when	you edge	off	the	process	and	start	prompting	them	to	go	on	their	own,	they	will	step up.

## Differences	in	the	Actual	Day-to-Day	PTing

So,	I	encourage	you	to	do	the	first	few	days	as	I've	laid	out	here.	It's	really	just that	physically	moving	your	child	to	the	potty	when	they	are	midpee.	That's	the most	important	step.

The	only	real	difference	if	you've	been	ECing	is	that	you	don't	put	away	the potty	you've	had	out.	I	only	recommend	doing	that	for	people	who	put	the	potty out	for	the	child	to	get	used	to	it.	Most	often	it's	misused	as	a	toy.	Clearly,	in your	home,	it's	been	used	correctly.

Should	your	child	pee	on	the	floor,	clearly	and	firmly	state	that	is	not	where pee	goes.	Pee	goes	in	the	potty.	Other	than	that,	those	first	few	days	should	be done	as	explained.

I	sincerely	commend	you	on	your	ECing.	I'm	thrilled	to	be	able	to	help	you with	teaching	your	child	to	completion.	It's	okay	to	have	many	feelings	about me,	EC,	and	all	I've	said.	I	know	many,	many	moms	who	are	really	upset	with how	little	EC	addresses	the	reality	of	completion.	And	I	know	many	moms	who were	upset	with	me	when	I	presented	them	'my	case.'	My	intention	is	not	to upset	but	to	pave	the	smoothest	road	to	potty	training	as	possible.

## CHAPTER	15

## Younger	Than	Twenty	Months,	Older Than	Three	Years

W e	could	also	call	this	chapter	'Potty	Training	Outside	of	My	Time	Frame.'

I always	 recommend	 starting	 potty	 training	 between	 twenty	 and	 thirty months.	In	my	vast	experience,	that's	where	the	magical	window	of	opportunity lies.	 Of	 course,	 many	 people	 want	 to	 potty	 train	 before	 twenty	 months,	 and some	parents,	for	whatever	reason,	have	waited	until	after	thirty	months.

If	 you	 are	 potty	 training	 before	 or	 after	 my	 suggested	 time	 frame	 it's	 still doable,	but	there	are	certain	considerations	of	which	you	need	to	be	aware.

## Under	Twenty	Months

It	is	completely	possible	to	potty	train	under	twenty	months.	A	few	things	that might	come	up	for	you	are:

## Lack	of	Communication

I've	discussed	this	elsewhere,	but	it's	worth	mentioning	again.	Think	about	this: your	 child	 is	 constantly	 communicating	 with	 you.	 It's	 up	 to	 you	 to	 decipher. Your	 child	 most	 likely	 is	 at	 the	 'point	 and	 scream'	 stage.	 While	 this	 is	 a delightful	 way	 to	 communicate,	 it's	 not	 always	 effective	 when	 potty	 training. The	best	thing	to	do	is	to	teach	your	child	the	sign	for	pee;	this	can	be	Standard American	Sign	Language	or	it	can	be	made	up.	However,	I	suggest	a	vocal	cue because	oftentimes	you	aren't	looking	right	at	your	child.	The	word pee is	 easy enough.	Some	moms	have	used	other	vocals	or	can	recognize	particular	screams. One	mom	figured	out	her	daughter	made	a	specific	 clicking	 noise.	 It	 became their	signal	for	'gotta	go.'	I	would	not	worry	about	differentiating	between	pee and	poop	as	far	as	words.	It's	going	to	come	soon	enough.

## Pulling	Down	the	Pants	and	Physically	Manipulating	Clothes

I discussed	 this	 in	 chapter	 4,	 'Mental	 Preparation,'	 if	 you	 missed	 it.	 You definitely	want	to	start	working	on	your	child	being	able	to	manipulate	his	own clothes	 as	 soon	 as	 possible.	 Of	 course,	 at	 this	 age	 your	 child	 will	 naturally	 be more	dependent	on	you	than	older	children	would	be.

## Prompting

Your	 child	 is	 going	 to	 need	 you	 more	 than	 an	 older	 child	 would.	 You	 will prompt	on	those	easy	catches	I've	referred	to	several	times.	You	must	keep	in mind	that you will	be	responsible	for	your	child	peeing	more	than	the	parent	of a	two-year-old	would	be.	Your	child will get	 it	 and will eventually	initiate,	but they	will	need	more	help.

## On	That	Note,	While	Potty	Training,	Teach	Your	Child	to	Get	You	for	Help

Charlene,	a	mom	I	just	recently	worked	with,	figured	out	her	nineteen-monthold	would	say	'up.'	Charlene	thought	she	wanted	to	get	up	in	her	arms.	She	was half	 right.	 Her	 daughter	 wanted	 up	 to	 be	 carried	 to	 the	 potty.	 It	 only	 took Charlene	two	times	of	being	peed	on	before	she	figured	it	out.

## A	Little	Potty	Chair	Is	Essential

BabyBjörn	makes	a	great	one.	Companies	that	specialize	in	EC	gear	have	very small	potties	available.	These	should	be	easy	for	your	child	either	to	sit	on	or	to back	themselves	onto.	It's	pretty	vital	to	have	a	little	chair	available.	I	often	get some	version	of	this:	'We	don't	really	like	the	little	potty	chair.	We	prefer	he learn	right	on	the	big	toilet,	since	that's	where	he'll	be	going.'	That's	okay,	I guess,	but	my	question	is,	'Don't	you	want	him	to	be	able	to	go	on	his	own?'

Until	 your	 child	 can	 physically	 maneuver	 onto	 the	 big	 toilet	 safely,	 he's going	to	need	your	help.	I	think	it's	 well	 worth	 the	 twenty	 dollars	 to	 get	 the little	potty.	Soon	enough,	he'll	move	to	the	big	toilet.	But	if	he	has	the	notion to	go	on	his	own,	we	certainly	want	to	make	it	available	for	him	to	do	so.

Be	Aware	That	This	Is	Likely	Going	to	Be	a	Longer	Process	for	the	Younger	Child

Not	necessarily	harder,	but	longer.	Progress	can	be	slower, and	that's	okay .	 Just don't	expect	it	to	be	done	in	week.	I	find	that	to	be	pretty	rare.	The	thing	to look	for	is	progress,	not	perfection.	As	long	as	you	see	him	making	consistent progress,	it's	all	good.

## Be	Really	Ready	to	Tell	Everyone	to	Frick	Off

No.	I'm	serious.	If	you	know	in	your	gut	that	your	kid	is	capable	of	this	and	you feel	ready, go	for	it .	But	society	is	going	to	tell	you	up,	down,	and	side-wise	that you	 are	 crazy.	 I	 do	 not	 think	 this	 is	 so.	 I	 congratulate	 you	 on	 your	 intuition! Fabulous.	Rock	on,	Mama,	and	don't	look	back.

You	will	start	the	plan	just	as	I	laid	it	out	in	chapter	5,	'Ditch	the	Diapers! The	How-To.'	Always	remember	that	the	goal	is	to	move	along	the	timeline from	 Clueless	 to	 I	 Peed	 to	 I'm	 Peeing	 to	 I	 Have	 to	 Go	 Pee.	 Each	 little component	may	take	a	bit	of	time.	It's	all	good	as	long	as	you	feel	progress.

I	hesitate	even	to	mention	what	I'm	about	to,	but	it	must	be	mentioned.	The child	under	twenty	months	can	be	'not	getting	it'	for	a	while	before	it	clicks. You	can	still	potty	train	a	young	child	who	is	a	little	clueless,	but	it	will	take longer,	and	it's	really	going	to	be	on	you.	If	you	work	outside	of	the	home	and don't	 have	 a	 willing	 care	 provider,	 you	 should	 probably	 wait.	 I	 would	 say, overall,	 a	 month	 is	 a	 very	 realistic	 time	 frame	 for	 progressing	 through	 the timeline.	 Does	 a	 month	 sound	 too	 long	 to	 you?	 Then	 wait.	 If	 that	 sounds amazing-one	small	month	to	be	done	with	diapers-proceed.

I	 will	 share	 my	 own	 story	 of	 potty	 training	 my	 son.	 My	 first	 attempt	 at training	 Pascal	 was	 at	 eighteen	 months.	 At	 the	 time,	 I	 was	 single	 mom	 (still am),	I	owned	a	clothing	store,	and	his	day	care	was	very	unwilling	(thought	he was	much	too	young).	Within	a	day	of	potty	training,	I	knew	he	wasn't	clicking on	his	own.	I	was	bummed	because	I	knew	it	was	possible	for	him,	but	in	my	life, at	that	time,	it	would	have	brought	more	stress.	I	let	it	go	and	he	potty	trained in	a	matter	of	days	when	he	was	twenty-two	months.

You	don't	know	what	kind	of	potty	trainer	you	have	till	you	jump	in	and	go for	 it.	 At	 this	 age,	 if	 it's	 not	 going	 according	 to	 plan	 you	 can	 always	 rediaper, and	it	will	not	hurt	the	process	one	bit.	There	is	a	lot	going	on	developmentally before	twenty	months,	and	your	child	just	may	not	have	the	skill	set.	If	you	feel able	to	be	there	and	help,	that's	awesome.	I'm	not	trying	to	scare	you	or	be	a	big bummer,	but	I	want	to	be	realistic	with	you.

## Potty	Training	the	Child	over	Thirty	Months

If	your	child	is	over	thirty	months	but	under	thirty-six	months,	you're	heading for	 a	 danger	 zone,	 but	 you	 are	 not	 fully	 in	 it	 yet.	 There's	 hope.	 The	 very	 first thing	 a	 mom	 with	 a	 kid	 over	 thirty	 months	 will	 tell	 me	 is	 'I	 feel	 so	 guilty.	 I waited	too	long,	and	now	the	window	of	opportunity	is	gone.'

First	off:	ditch	the	guilt	right	now.	Leave	it	on	the	ground	and	walk	over	it. Guilt	 serves	 no	 one.	 I'm	 sure	 you	 honestly	 thought	 you	 were	 waiting	 for readiness	or	the	right	time.	I'm	really	sure	you	didn't	think, Wow.	I'd	really	like to	 f**k	 up	 potty	 training .	 So	 leave	 the	 guilt.	 You	 are	 where	 you	 are	 and	 that's okay.

You	are	going	to	do	the	training	just	as	I	lay	it	out	in	chapter	5,	'Ditch	the Diapers!	The	How-To.'	The	only	thing	you	really	need	to	be	aware	of	is	the behavior	 stuff.	 The	 resistance	 that	 comes	 from	 a	 kid	 over	 thirty	 months	 isn't usually	because	of	learning.	It's	usually	just	because	you	are	saying	one	thing	and they	are	automatically	going	to	say	another.	You	are	definitely	going	to	dance between	 prompting	 and	 the	 backing	 off.	 The	 older	 child	 needs	 much	 more privacy, so pay close attention to that. They also need much more independence.	 The	 'walk	 away'	 prompt	 is	 the	 best.	 That's	 when	 you	 remind them	in	a	casual	way,	such	as,	'I	can	see	you	have	to	pee.	There's	your	potty.' And	physically	and	mentally	walk	away.

The	older	child	is	also	most	likely	going	to	have	poop	troubles.	Go	back	and read	all	of	chapter	10,	'Poop,'	paying	close	attention	to	the	'glaring	spotlight.' These	older	 kids	 are	 just	 that	 much	 more	 attached	 to	 the	 security	 blanket	 of diapers.	 Privacy	 and	 independence	 are	 your	 best	 bet.	 As	 I've	 said,	 thirty	 to thirty-six	 months	 is	 not	 a	 danger	 zone	 .	 .	 .	 just	 sort	 of	 a	 no-man's	 land	 of fuzziness.	It's	time	to	really	do	this	now,	with	conviction	and	consistency.

## If	Your	Child	Is	Thirty-Six	Months	or	Over

We	don't	have	time	to	beat	around	the	bush.	To	me,	this	is	the	danger	zone.	I know	many	people	are	convinced	that	three	is	the	new	age	to	potty	train.	In	my experience,	it's	infinitely	harder.

So	again,	ditch	the	guilt.	You	are	where	you	are,	and	we	can't	change	that. Okay?	 I'm	 imagining	 you	 were	 'waiting	 till	 she	 was	 ready,'	 and	 now	 she's showing	 no	 signs	 of	 being	 ready.	 Or	 you	 need	 to	 get	 into	 a	 preschool.	 Or something	clicked	in	your	head	to	get	this	done	now.

Whatever	the	case,	it's	seriously	time	to	put	your	big	mama	panties	on	and really	get	this	done.	When	a	child	is	three	or	older,	there's	actually	very	little learning	to	be	done	with	regard	to	the	potty.	It's	highly	unlikely	that	your	child is	brand-new	to	potty	training.	Most	kids	at	this	age	have	simply	rejected	your attempts,	be	it	in	a	big,	violent	tantrum	kind	of	way	or	a	constant	peeing-inpants	quieter	way.	Regardless	of	what	you've	done	in	the	past	with	your	child, go	 ahead	 and	 start	 the	 whole	 process	 as	 I	 laid	 out	 in	 chapter	 5,	 'Ditch	 the Diapers!	The	How-To.'	Even	if	you	have	some	success	under	your	belt.

Former	 client	 Mary	 came	 to	 me	 because	 her	 son,	 Dillon,	 was	 thirty-eight months.	He	was	being	denied	admission	to	a	preschool	because	he	wasn't	fully toilet	trained.	Dillon	could	pee	on	the	potty	most	of	the	time,	but	poop	was	hit or	miss.	Sometimes	he'd	do	it	in	his	pants,	sometimes	make	it	to	the	potty.	He was	still	having	a	few	pee	accidents	as	well.	Sometimes	he	was	wildly	resistant	to the	potty	and	other	times,	he'd	just	go.	It	looked	like	a	hot	mess,	and	of	course, Mary	was	going	crazy	because	of	the	preschool	thing.	It	was,	like, serious .

I	recommended	she	go	back	to	that	first	naked	day.	She	really	fought	me.	She didn't	think	he	needed	to	go	back.	She	felt	that	he	had	made	enough	progress that	he	didn't	need	to	go	backward.

But	 in	 a	 case	 like	 this	 and	 maybe	 in	 yours, we	 need	 to	 know	 where	 it	 went wrong .	You	can't	go	back	and	fix	something	if	you	don't	know	what	went	wrong in	the	first	place.	Right?	And	clearly,	something	went	wrong.	It's	about	going back	and	getting	those	blocks	of	learning,	those	phases,	rock	solid.	And	playing around	with	them	if	they	are	not.

In	short,	Mary	went	back	and	did	the	progression	of	blocks	like	I	laid	out. And	it	clicked	for	Dillon.	We	never	did	get	an	'ah-ha!'	as	to	what	went	wrong. It	wasn't	very	clear	to	either	of	us.	But	just	going	back	and	doing	it	all	in	order made	it	work	for	Dillon.

The	best	analogy	I	can	make	is,	say	a	kid	has	learned	twenty	letters	of	the alphabet.	That's	a	good	chunk	of	the	alphabet,	right?	But	kind	of	useless	without the	 other	 six	 letters.	 Now,	 you	 can't	 just	 throw	 those	 letters	 at	 the	 kid	 and expect	him	to	put	them	in	order.	You	have	to	start	at	A	and	then	go	to	B	and insert	the	letters	into	the	alphabet.	I	know	and	you	know	that	he's	got	A	and	B, but	without	going	back	over	them,	the	kid	will	have	no	frame	of	reference	with regard	to	the	other	six	letters.

Same	 thing	 with	 whatever	 struggles	 you	 are	 having	 with	 potty	 training.	 I don't	 know	 what	 went	 wrong,	 and	 I'm	 guessing	 you	 don't	 know	 what	 went wrong.	So	just	start	 over.	 The	 parts	 he's	 got	 will	 just	 be	 review.	 And	 as	 with Mary,	I	wouldn't	look	for	some	big	'ah-ha!'	I've	done	this	with	thousands	of kids.	I	know,	know,	know	this	progression	works.

So	that's	your	first	task.	Take	it	back	to	the	beginning.	While	you	might	not have an 'ah-ha!' moment, it may become very clear that you were overprompting	 and	 not	 handing	 it	 over	 to	 him	 enough	 or	 something	 similar. The	biggest	problems	I	see	in	kids	over	three	are	behavior	issues.	My	party	line is that	 most	 kids	 start	 to	 hit	 individuation	 around	 this	 time.	 This	 is	 the psychological	process	by	which	your	child	starts	to	separate	from	you.	This	age	is marked	by	pushing	against	you	and	limit	testing.	It's	good	and	normal,	but	when you	add	pee	and	poop	to	this,	you've	set	yourself	up	for	the	granddaddy	of	all power	struggles.	As	I'm	sure	you	know.	I'm	not	saying	that	to	rub	your	nose	in	it -it's	just	good	to	know	what	you	are	up	against.

The	best	way	to	end	a	power	struggle	is	to	let	go	of	your	end	of	the	rope.	All right,	Jamie,	so	how	the	eff	do	I	do	that?

You	give	this	(responsibility	for	the	learning)	to	them.	You	don't	argue.	You don't	 cajole.	 You	 don't	 beg	 or	 negotiate.	 And	 you	 never,	 ever	 let	 them	 smell your	fear.

You	 begin	 that	 first	 day	 with,	 'We	 have	 not	 done	 a	 good	 job	 with	 potty training,	so	I'm	going	to	help	you	learn	it	the	right	way.	You're	going	to	help	by letting	me	know	when	you	have	to	pee	or	by	going	yourself.	There's	the	little potty	or	the	big	toilet.	You	can	choose.'	Most	kids	are	really	waiting	for	you	to show	up	with	the	consistency.	I'm	not	saying	that's	always	the	case,	but	often	it is.	So	here	you	are,	waiting	for	them,	and	all	this	time,	they've	been	waiting	on you.	I	know	.	.	.	f**k.	It's	okay,	though.

If,	during	that	day,	you	are	met	with	resistance,	you	continue	to	back	off.	For instance,	use	that	throwaway	prompt	'You	have	to	pee,	there's	your	potty.' You must	leave	room	for	him	to	make	the	good	decision	himself. This	could	take	a	day	or two,	 so	 be	 patient.	 You	 want	 to	 dance	 along	 the	 delicate	 line	 between prompting	and	backing	off.

Now,	for	most	parents,	that's	going	to	be	enough.	Time	after	time,	I've	seen moms	shocked	at	how	quickly	and	easily	it	went	with	a	former	Potty	Monster. Often,	I	really	think	it's	a	matter	of	(a)	the	consistency	and	(b)	going	back	and learning.	 If	 a	 kid	 doesn't	 'get'	 all	 the	 components	 of	 a	 process	 (like	 potty training),	 they	 tend	 to	 stop	 caring.	 I	 call	 it	 the	 'inner	 f**k	 it.'	 Which	 is basically	them	saying,	'I	suck	at	this,	so	I'm	not	going	to	try.'	Our	kids want to do	 well.	 They want to	 do	 the	 right	 thing.	 We	 have	 to	 believe	 that.	 A	 lot	 of resistance	in	the	older	kid	is	because	they	haven't	learned	something	quite	the right	way.

You	see	this	same	attitude	coming	from	the	kid	who's	kind	of	the	punk	in school.	He	slouches,	doesn't	pay	attention,	is	the	class	clown.	It's	usually	this	kid who,	it	turns	out,	never	learned	to	read	or	has	a	learning	disorder.	We	want	to assume	your	child	is	just	missing	a	component.

Now	 you	 might	 start	 at	 the	 beginning,	 make	 it	 through	 a	 few	 days,	 and everything	seems	okay.	Then	you	go	back	to	daily	life	and-whoops!-poop	in the	pants	again.	I	highly	suggest	using	a	small,	immediate	consequence. Not as punishment,	 but	 more	 to	 find	 out	 if	 your	 child	 can	 use	 the	 potty	 properly	 if motivated	 to	 do	 so.	 We	 need	 to	 know	 if	 this	 is	 him	 not	 caring	 or	 being	 lazy about	it	or	if	this	is	something	he	can't	control.	It	becomes	very	clear	whether	or not	he	can	do	what	we're	asking	when	we	add	in	an	external	motivator.	The consequence	 should	 be	 something	 that	 matters	 to	 your	 child	 but	 nothing overboard.	As	I	said,	this	is	a	pretty	quick,	noninvasive	way	of	figuring	out	if your	struggles	are	due	to	behavior	or	something	else.

It's	helpful	to	separate	out	potty	training	from	behavior.	If	your	child won't sit when	you	ask	him,	that's	 behavior.	 If	 you	 know	 your	 child can use	 the	 potty because	he's	done	so	in	the	past,	though	at	other	times	he	can't	be	bothered, that's	 behavior.	 Behavior	 always	 needs	 a	 consequence.	 Often,	 clients	 tell	 me that	 it	 sounds	 wrong	 to	 give	 a	 consequence	 when	 dealing	 with	 elimination issues.	 What	 I	 like	 to	 do	 (as	 I've	 recommended	 in	 a	 previous	 chapter),	 and	 I encourage	you	to	do	as	well,	is	to	put	the	behavior	into	another	context.	If	your child	doesn't	want	to	eat	to	dinner,	and	he	takes	his	plate	and	dumps	it	on	the floor,	what	do	you	do?	An	older	child	who	cannot	be	bothered	to	sit	and	put	his poop	on	the	potty	is	doing	just	that.	'Nah.	I'm	good.	I'll	just	poop	in	my	pants, and	you	can	clean	it	up.'

It's been	 my	 experience	 that	 you	 can feel when	 you	 need	 to	 use	 a consequence.	You	will	feel	like	a	game	is	being	played	and	you	are	the	sucker. You	will	feel	like	you	are	being	'abused.'

Now,	if	you	are	still	having	accidents,	but	it	doesn't feel like	behavior,	here's the	 most	 recent	 deal:	 many,	 many	 children-especially	 kids	 over	 three-are actually	 constipated. Listen	 up: this	 can	 be	 true	 even	 if	 your	 child	 is	 pooping three	 times	 a	 day.	 There	 can	 be	 backed-up	 poop	 that	 could	 be	 creating difficulties	across	the	board.	I	know	how	crazy	this	sounds,	but	it's	true.	What many	parents	have	learned	is	that	the	easiest	way	to	figure	this	out	is	to	get	an x-ray	 done.	 Your	 doctor	 will	 be	 able	 to	 tell	 you.	 Your	 doctor	 might	 also recommend	a	prescription	laxative.	This	is	by	far	the	most	common	protocol.	I certainly	don't	want	to	alarm	you,	but	this	situation	is	becoming	more	and	more common	and	I'm	not	sure	why.

The	biggest	marker	for	potential	constipation	is	that	your	child	is	over	three and	sincerely	seems	to	be	trying-I	mean	over	an	extended	period	of	time,	not	a few	days	of	potty	training-and	they	show	remorse	at	accidents.	They	seem	to honestly	try	to	make	it,	but	sometimes	the	poop	comes	too	fast.	Or	whether	they make	it	to	the	potty	in	time	seems	completely	random.	What	I've	come	to	learn is	this	sort	of	counterintuitive	constipation	really	messes	with	a	child's	ability	to feel	the	poop	is	coming.	If	you	have	a	little	one	over	the	age	of	three	who	does seem	to	be	trying	and	can't	get	the	poop	in	the	potty	consistently,	I	feel	like	an x-ray	is	a	pretty	easy	fix	before	things	get	worse.	There	is	also	a	program	called

Soiling	 Solutions	 for	 children	 over	 three	 and	 a	 half.	 I	 hear	 wonderful	 things about	this	program,	so	though	I	haven't	personally	used	it,	I	feel	very	confident in	recommending	it.

But	there	is	another	variety	of	the	older	child	that	gets	ugly.	This	is	the	child who	is	being	resistant	in	an	'eff	you'	kind	of	way.	This	child	will	look	right	at you	while	he's	peeing	on	the	floor.	You	will	know	if	you	have	this	variety.	It	will feel aggressive,	and	you	will	feel	hostage	to	your	child.	This	behavior	needs	to	be addressed	head	on.	This	is	not	funny	and	can	lead	to	serious	issues	later	on.	You must	deal	with	this	as	behavior	and	behavior	only.	Do	whatever	you	would	do	as if	he	looked	you	right	in	the	eyes	and	said,	'Eff	you.'	'Cause	that's	kind	of	what he's	 doing.	 I	 highly	 suggest	 contacting	 a	 family	 therapist	 if	 this	 is	 happening. This	actually	is	not	at	all	about	potty	training.	I	do	think	it's	serious,	and	I	do think	you	should	seek	help	and	not	take	it	lightly.

Bottom	line:	when	you	have	a	child	over	three,	potty	training	needs	to	be addressed	in	a	very	straightforward	manner.	It	needs	to	be	done,	and	done	now, at	 almost	 any	 cost.	 The	 child	 over	 three	 is	 much	 more	 likely	 to	 have	 bigger problems.	 I	 know	 so	 many	 parents	 are	 fearful	 of	 seeming	 'hard-core'-they don't	want	to	traumatize	their	kid.	I	get	that,	totally.	I	never	want	to	see	a	kid traumatized, either. But in my	 humble opinion, getting kicked out of kindergarten	 for	 potty	 training	 issues	 is	 a	 lot	 more	 traumatizing	 than	 having parents	who	are	super	strict	now.

## CHAPTER	16

## The	Reset

I 've	coined	the	term	'Reset'	for	those	instances	in	which,	for	whatever	reason, potty	training	has	completely	unraveled	and	you	need	a	do-over.	An	erase.	A start	again.

The	Reset	can	be	used	only	once.	It	is	NO	GOOD	if	used	more	than	once.	It means	you	rediaper	your	child	and	forgo	all	things	potty	and	potty	training.	The optimal	length	of	a	Reset	is	two	to	four	weeks.	Any	shorter	isn't	enough	time, and	any	longer	can	create	more	'addiction'	to	the	diaper.

The	best	way	to	tell	if	you	need	a	Reset	is	if	you	are	at	the	end	of	your	rope. By	this,	I	don't	mean	you're	feeling	the	normal	exhaustion	and	frustration	that the	first	few	days	of	potty	training	can	bring.	Rather,	the	Reset	is	for	those	of you	that	have	given	it	your	all,	and	I	do	mean	your all .	I	want	your	child	potty trained,	 yes.	 But	 I	 also	 want	 you	 sane	 and	 your	 home	 harmonious.	 If	 you	 are feeling	strung	out,	a	little	insane,	and	you've	been	cleaning	pee	off	the	floor	for more	than	two	weeks,	consider	a	Reset.	If	your	entire	life	revolves	around	trying to	figure	out	when	this	kid	is	gonna	let	loose,	and	you	have	no	other	thoughts besides	potty	training,	consider	a	Reset.

There	are	two	major	times	to	do	a	Reset.

- 1.	Before	using	this	book.	You	have	tried	potty	training	in	any	way,	shape,	or	form,	and	you	have	a disaster	on	your	hands.	Or	even	just	a	hot	mess.	So	you	heard	from	a	friend	about	my	book	and you	ran	to	the	computer	to	buy	it.	You	are	gung-ho	to	start,	but	you	have	this	writhing	mess	on your	hands.	RESET.
- 2.	After	getting	this	book	and	giving	a	really	solid	effort.	Either	your	child	never	got	it	or	got	it	and her	behavior	suddenly	flipped	and	she's	crazy	every	time	you	mention	the	potty.	Also	looks	like	a hot	mess,	and	you	cannot	figure	out	what	happened.	RESET.

The	 Reset	 should	 never	 be	 used	 with	 a	 child	 over	 three.	 If	 you	 refer	 to chapter	15,	'Younger	Than	Twenty	Months,	Older	Than	Three	Years,'	you	will see	 that	 any	 child	 over	 three	 who's	 'not	 getting	 it'	 is	 most	 likely	 showing behavior ,	not	a	glitch	in	learning.

The	reasoning	behind	the	Reset	is	this:	first	and	foremost,	it	gives	you	and your	 household	 a	 big	 breather.	 We	 need	 you	 sane	 to	 be	 effective.	 If	 you	 are crying	over	potty	training,	there's	just	no	way	you	are	going	to	able	to	keep	firm and	consistent.	 You will slip	 into	 bribery	 and	 negotiation.	 I	 know	 this.	 Much like	 a	 torturer,	 your	 toddler will break	 you.	 And	 you'll	 be	 all	 over	 the	 map, which	sends	the	signal	that	you	are	not	in	control.	If	you	are	not	in	control, your	child	is.	And	that's	unsafe	for	your	child.

The	 other	 thing	 the	 Reset	 does	 is	 it	 gives	 your	 child	 a	 chance	 to	 collect himself	with	a	status	quo	he	knows	(diapers).	Potty	training	is	a	lot	to	learn.	But if	he	is	resisting	you,	he	is	stuck	in	a	rut.	Much	as	during	a	tantrum,	nothing	can be	learned	from	this	place.	(You	ever	try	to	reason	with	a	tantrumming	toddler? Yeah	 .	 .	 .	 right?).	 If	 your	 child	 is	 stuck	 in	 a	 rut,	 there's	 really	 no	 point	 in continuing.	The	days	where	there	are	fights	are	not	days	that	count	toward	good potty	training.	Nothing	was	learned.

Finally,	the	Reset	lets	your	toddler	'win'	a	little	bit,	which	is	a	good	thing.	It can	settle	her	and	make	the	next	go-around	calmer.	She	won	one,	you	get	to win	one.	I	know	that	sounds	odd,	but	it's	true.

As	a	side	note,	perhaps	you	are	not	getting	resistance,	just	utter	cluelessness from	your	child,	and	wonder	whether	a	Reset	is	warranted.	In	such	a	case,	you have	to	be	the	judge.	Utter	cluelessness	for	more	than	a	week	is	something	I have	never	seen	in	a	child	over	twenty-four	months	of	age.	I've	seen	kids	not want	 to	 deal	 with	 the	 potty	 or	 pretend	 it	 doesn't	 exist,	 but	 that's	 not cluelessness.	That's	passive	resistance	and	should	be	worked	through.	We'll	talk about	kids	younger	than	twenty-four	months	in	a	minute.

So	how	do	you	handle	a	Reset?

First,	you	rediaper.	I'd	prefer	you	do	this	at	night	before	bed	and	just	continue doing	 so	 in	 the	 morning.	 The	 one	 thing	 I'd	 like	 you	 to	 avoid	 is	 returning	 to diapers	in	the	middle	of	a	fit	of	resistance.	She's	screaming	and	you	say,	'Fine! Put	a	diaper	on!'	This	is	her	'winning'	(in	a	very	different	way	than	the	good kind	of	'winning'	I	mentioned	a	few	paragraphs	ago),	and	it	will	send	the	wrong message.

The	message	we	want	to	send-and	you	can	use	these	exact	words-is,	'You are	not	using	the	potty	properly,	so	we	are	going	to	use	a	diaper	again	so	we	can all	calm	down.'	This	isn't	meant	as	punishment	or	giving	in.	This	is	merely	to regroup.

Second,	 you	 put	 away	 the	 potty	 chair,	 and	 you	 don't	 say	 boo	 about	 potty training.	You	will	mostly	likely	get	one	of	the	following	reactions:

- 1.	Nothing.	No	mention	of	it,	and	you	actually	can	sense	relief	in	your	child.
- 2.	Your	child	asks	about	it	but	doesn't	ask	to	use	it.	Use	that	statement	above	and	then	change	the subject.	This	is	not	the	time	to	lecture	about	her	misuse	of	the	potty.
- 3.	Your	child	suddenly,	for	the	first	time,	asks	to	use	the	potty.	I'll	get	to	this	one	in	another	minute.

Third,	you	breathe	normally	for	the	first	time	in	a	long	time.	You	most	likely will	have	the	experience	of	'having	your	kid	back.'	Enjoy	this	time.	Don't	linger in	the	past	or	be	freaked	out	by	the	future.	It	is	what	it	is,	and	it's	meant	to	be	a time	of	regrouping	and	regaining	harmony.

Fourth,	set	a	new	date.	Again,	two	to	four	weeks	from	the	start	of	the	Reset	is best.	Your	child	will	be	marinating	all	the	potty	thoughts	in	her	head.	It	won't all	go	out	the	window,	I	promise	you.	Hold	that	date	in	your	thoughts,	and	you can	even	throw	it	out	there	casually	a	few	times:	'You	are	not	using	the	potty properly,	 so	 we	 put	 it	 away.	 Don't	 worry,	 we'll	 start	 again	 on	 Monday	 [or whatever].'	 Casually.	 Just	 so	 your	 child	 knows	 it's	 coming,	 but	 it's	 not	 this looming	fear.

Now,	if	your	child	asks	to	use	the	potty	and	it	does	seem	like	she	will	use	it correctly,	you	can	give	her one	shot .	You	can	either	take	the	potty	out	or	you	can use	the	insert.	If	she	does	indeed	use	the	potty	the	right	way,	you	can	tell	her 'Thank	you.	I	will	leave	the	potty	out	for	you.	If	you	don't	use	it,	it	goes	away again	for	 a	 while.'	 If	 there	 is	 even	 one	 time	 of	 her	 not	 using	 it	 properly,	 you need	to	follow	through	with	the	Reset.	No	matter	what	she	says.	This cannot become	 a	 game.	 It's	 either	 use	 the	 potty	 or	 don't	 use	 the	 potty.	 Again,	 if	 it becomes	a	game,	it	puts	her	in	charge,	and	that's	not	psychologically	safe.

A	few	words	about	the	Reset	and	the	child's	age.	As	I've	mentioned,	if	your child	is	over	three,	you	will	not	want	to	use	the	Reset.	Period.	However,	if	your child	is	under	twenty-two	months,	you	may	want	to	do	a	Reset,	but	you	will	go about	it	differently.	For	the	child	under	twenty-two	months,	there	is	a	very	real possibility	that	she	is	clueless.	There's	a	lot	going	on	developmentally	and	the timing	may	just	be	off.	Please	don't	use	this	as	a	cop	out.	I	have	sixteen-montholds	 who	 potty	 train	 with	 no	 problem.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 potty	 train	 between sixteen	 and	 twenty-two	 months,	that	is	awesome.	Chances	are	your	child	has shown	some	indication	that	this	is	possible.	Go	with	your	intuition.	You	should have	a	sense	of	progress.	If	you	see no progress,	consider	a	Reset.

For	this	child,	you	do	not	need	to	put	the	potty	away.	If	they	indicate	that they'd	like	to	use	the	potty,	it's	fine.	With	this	age,	there's	usually	little	to	no behavior	 going	 on.	 The	 child	 is	 just	 really	 not	 connecting	 the	 dots.	 You	 still want	 to	 set	 a	 new	 start	 date,	 perhaps	 a	 little	 longer	 out	 than	 four	 weeks,	 for when	you'll	try	again.	You	do	want	to	keep	that	in	your	head,	so	diapers	don't sort	of	take	over.

Just	to	be	clear,	from	twenty-two	to	twenty-four	months	is	an	unclear	zone	:). Sometimes	a	child	can	be	truly	clueless	and	sometimes	not.	It's	for	you	to	call.	I would	look	back	on	their	other	milestones	and	see	if	they	were	on	target	or	early or	late.	That's	usually	the	best	indicator.

Two	things	often	happen	when	parents	read	this	chapter	or	feel	they	might need	a	Reset.	The	first	is	that	I'll	hear	from	a	parent	who's	at	the	end	of	her	rope on	the	second	day	of	potty	training	and	wants	to	know	if	a	Reset	is	appropriate. I'm	 very	 sorry,	 and	 I	 don't	 mean	 to	 sound	 hard-core,	 but	 that's	 a	 ridiculously small	amount	of	time	in	which	to	lose	your	marbles.	Your	child	is	learning	a	new skill,	and	no	other	major	milestone	has	been	achieved	in	so	short	a	time	frame. Put	your	big	girl	panties	on	and	step	up	to	the	plate.	This	is	your	child,	and you have	 the	 magic.	 Adjust,	 get	 creative,	 think	 about	 what	 might	 be	 going	 on. There's	 a	 fair	 amount	 of	 thinking	 on	 your	 feet	 about	 your	 particular	 child needed	here.	Here	I	go	again	saying	the	same	thing,	but	you	are	the	expert	on your	kid.

The second reaction I get is massive resistance to the Reset-an overwhelming	sense	of, 'No	way.' The	parents	feel	that	the	Reset	would	be	a massive	backslide.	Many	parents	will	point	to	the	one	pee	they	got	in	the	potty in	the	last	three	days.	'She	did	it	once!	See?'	To	which	I	say,	'Listen.	I	truly believe	in	most	instances	that	working	through	the	problems	is	the	best	way	to potty	train.	But	one	pee	on	the	potty	in	three	days	in	week	two	of	potty	training is	 not	 progress.	 You	 are	 stuck.	 The	 only	 way	 to	 get	 unstuck	 is	 to	 change something.'

There's	a	great	Einstein	quote:	'The	definition	of	insanity	is	doing	the	same thing	over	and	over	again,	expecting	different	results.'

Chances	are,	by	the	time	you	are	considering	a	Reset,	you	have	tried	many, many	 different	 things.	 For	 whatever	 reason,	 it's	 not	 working.	 We	 will	 never know	why.	But	we	do	need	to	shake	things	up	a	bit,	and	that's	what	the	Reset does.	It	shakes	things	up	and	calms	them	down.	While	you	are	figuring	out	what might	have	gone	wrong	or	what	you	could	change,	and	at	the	same	time	you	are still	potty	training	and	are	getting	nothing	but	pee	on	the	floor,	you	are	going	to go	insane.	Insane	moms	are	wildly	ineffective	teachers.

As	I	mentioned	in	the	beginning	of	the	chapter,	the	Reset	is	good	for	before or	 after	 starting	 this	 book.	 NOT	 BOTH.	 So	 let's	 say,	 you	 have	 a	 child	 who's twenty-eight	 months.	 You've	 given	 potty	 training	 a	 pretty	 good	 attempt,	 not using	my	book,	and	now	.	.	.	you	don't	have	a	potty	trained	kid,	per	se,	but	you don't	have	a	disaster	either.	You	bought	my	book	to	seal	the	deal.	If	you	don't have	a	disaster,	I'd	jump	right	in	with	that	first	day.	Many	times	I	hear,	'I	think she	 was	 just	 waiting	 for	 me	 to	 throw	 away	 the	 diapers.' Or you	 can	 choose	 a start	date	in	two	weeks	and	rediaper	her	till	then.

If	you	have	read	this	book	because	you do have	a	disaster,	I'd	definitely	Reset your	child	before	beginning	again.

Once	again,	as	throughout	this	whole	book,	it's	impossible	for	me	to	know your	 exact	 situation.	 I	 trust	 your	 intuition,	 and	 you	 should	 do	 the	 same.	 You know	your	child	best.	Weigh	your	options	and	see	what	feels	right	to	you.

The	Reset	really,	really	is	good	only	one	time.	Otherwise,	you	will	teach	your child	that	if	she	pitches	a	big	enough	fit,	you	will	cave	in	to	what	she	wants.	I think	we	can	all	agree	that	this	is	a	disaster	in	the	making.

CHAPTER	17

## Special	Circumstances

## Extreme	Fear	of	the	Potty

A s	I	mentioned	in	chapter	7,	'Block	One	Drama,'	and	chapter	8,	'Block	Two and	 Three	 Dilemmas,'	 you	 may	 have	 a	 child	 who	 shows	 extreme	 fear	 of	 the potty.	This	child	is rare .	 I've	had	only	eleven	of	them	in	all	my	years	of	doing this.	But	they	do	exist.

First,	you	need	to	ascertain	that	this	truly	is	fear-not	resistance	and	not	the usual	minor	fear	a	child	will	show	at	doing	something	new.	One	mom	equated the	appearance	of	'true	fear'	with	that	of	a	cat	being	stuffed	into	a	small	bucket of	water.	If	your	child	looks	something	like	that,	the	fear	is	real,	and	it's	there from	the	get-go.	Most	often	it	appears	that	these	kids	are	afraid	of	the	actual potty,	 but	 it	 could	 also	 be	 the	 sensation	 of	 releasing	 the	 pee/poop	 or	 both. Sometimes	it's	unclear	which	of	these	two	(or	both)	is	the	culprit.	There's	no talking	to	this	child,	and	this	isn't	behavior.

The	number	one	thing	to	remember	is	that	this	child	will	be	able	to	learn nothing as	long	as	she's	in	this	place	of	fear,	so	don't	even	bother.	If	it	looks	like you	 have	 a	 truly	 fearful	 child	 (and	 you	 will	 know	 for	 sure	 within	 a	 couple	 of days),	then	I	want	you	to	approach	potty	training	differently.	You	are	going	to go	 about	 it	 much	 slower	 and,	 contrary	 to	 all	 I've	 said	 elsewhere	 in	 the	 book, you're	going	to	take	a	casual	approach.

Casual	potty	training is possible.	What	happens	in	most	cases,	though,	is	that the	diapers	sort	of	take	over,	and	pretty	soon	you're	not	doing any sort	of	potty training.	If	your	child	is	deeply	fearful,	you	have	to	go	slower,	but	you	will	still be	potty	training.	First,	though,	we	must	get	past	the	fear.

You	will	keep	the	potty	chair	out,	preferably	in	the	bathroom,	and	it	should be	something	like	the	BabyBjörn	chair.	I'd	prefer	it	not	be	one	that	can	be	used as	a	step	stool	or	could	be	mistaken	for	anything	but	a	potty	chair.	Take	your child	with	you	as	often	as	possible	when	you	go.	She	can	sit	on	it,	with	pants	on, if	she	will.	You	can	casually	ask	her	if	she	wants	to	use	it.	Asking	is	okay	with this	 child.	 You	 actually do need	 her	 permission.	 This	 is	 the	 rare	 instance	 of	 a child	who	does	need	to	get	used	the	potty	chair.	You	can	try	to	get	her	to	pee	on it	 before	 a	 bath	 or	 when	 she's	 getting	 dressed	 in	 the	 morning.	 You	 will	 move slowly.	If	she	says	no,	you	should	say,	'Okay.	Maybe	tomorrow.'	Keep	at	it,	not like	a	pit	bull	but	with	steady	strokes.

Now,	I've	had	only	eleven	kids	to	work	through	this	with,	so	I	can't	claim	to be	a	full-blown	expert	on	the	this	kind	of	fear.	But	moving	steadily	at	the	child's pace	worked	perfectly	for	those	eleven.	All	took	around	two	months	of	steady work,	and	then	they	were	potty	trained.	I	would	venture	to	say	that	if	the	fear persists	and	you	see	no	forward	movement,	look	to	see	if	there	is	another	source of	 anxiety.	 More	 and	 more	 children	 are	 getting	 anxiety	 disorder	 diagnoses.	 If you	 feel	 your	 child	 is	 overly	 anxious,	 you	 should	 seek	 help.	 I'm	 not	 trying	 to freak	 you	 out,	 but	 early	 intervention	 is	 by	 far	 the	 best	 cure.	 As	 I	 stated	 in chapter	10,	'Poop,'	I	think	the	general	state	of	the	world	is	causing	this	anxiety in	our	children,	not	you	or	anything	you	are	doing.

## Preemies

If	your	child	was	premature	by	more	than	four	weeks,	spent	any	significant	time in	 the	 NICU	 (neonatal	 intensive	 care	 unit),	 or	 had	 trouble	 bonding,	 potty training	could	be	delayed.	However,	this	is	not	necessarily	so,	and	by	'delayed,' I	 mean	 it	 might	 come	 closer	 to	 thirty	 months	 than	 twenty	 months.	 I'm	 not saying	 to	 wait	 till	 she's	 three	 and	 a	 half.	 Preemies	 tend	 to	 be	 slightly	 behind their	peers	in	other	areas	as	well.	I	would	look	at	other	milestones.	If	all	were	a bit	delayed,	I'd	factor	that	in	to	potty	training.	Do	this	not	as	an	excuse	to	wait too	long,	but	to	give	your	child	the	time	she	needs	to	'catch	up.'	Most	kids	I've worked	with	in	this	category	are	all	caught	up	by	twenty-four	months.

## Adoption

If	you	have	adopted	a	child,	particularly	from	another	country,	you	should	focus on	forming	a	bond	before	beginning	potty	training.	I	once	had	a	mom	attend	my class,	and	it	turns	out	that	her	adopted	daughter	came	to	her	quite	bruised.	Due to	 lack	 of	 staff,	 the	 orphanage	 would	 tie	 the	 children	 to	 the	 potty	 until	 they produced.	 Obviously,	 this	 child	 did	 not	 need	 to	 start	 potty	 training	 any	 time soon.	I	have	never	seen	an	adopted	child	have	any	problems	with	potty	training, so	I	wouldn't	give	it	any	thought	except	to	say	not	to	rush	it.	If	you	adopted	your child	at	a	very	young	age,	you	can	proceed	with	training	as	I've	described	with no	problem.

When	 I	 first	 met	 Mona,	 she	 had	 just	 adopted	 her	 son	 who	 was	 twenty months	 old.	 He	 was	 very	 bright	 and	 seemed	 very	 capable	 and	 ready	 to	 potty train.	We	both	suspected	potty	training	had	already	been	started	in	his	native country.	 He	 didn't	 click	 and	 after	 a	 few	 days	 started	 to	 show	 fear	 around	 the potty.	We	both	decided	that,	given	the	huge	transition	he'd	just	been	through, it	would	be	best	to	go	about	training	as	I	described	in	'Extreme	Fear'	on	page 229.	 Within	 a	 month,	 he	 was	 potty	 trained.	 Mona	 was	 thrilled	 because	 even though	it	took	longer	than	she	originally	hoped,	it	was	still	pretty	awesome	to have	 him	 trained.	 It's	 almost	 the	 nature	 of	 adoption	 that	 your	 child,	 upon coming	home	to	you,	his	mom,	is	coming	to	a	much	better	place.	Regardless, this	 is	 still	 a major transition,	 as	 is	 potty	 training.	 Go	 with	 your	 gut	 and	 your motherly	intuition.

## Emotional	and	Developmental	Delays

If	your	child	has	been	diagnosed	with	emotional	or	developmental	delays,	then potty	training could be	delayed.	I	say	'diagnosed'	because	every	child	develops differently,	and	while	you	may	think	something	is	up,	it	doesn't	have	to	mean she's	 delayed.	I	 know	kids	who	haven't	said	a	word	until	they	were	three	and then	busted	out	with	full	conversations.	I	sometimes	see	parents	use	this	as	an excuse:	'Well,	he's	not	really	delayed,	but	he	doesn't	do	such	and	such	.	.	.	I don't	know	if	he's	ready	to	potty	train.'	So	I	'require'	a	diagnosis	in	order	to justify	 delayed	 potty	 training.	 Obviously,	 the	 severity	 of	 the	 delay	 will	 dictate when	potty	training	should	begin.	This	is	best	discussed	with	your	pediatrician.	I would	simply	ask,	'Is	there	any	reason	Johnny	can't	start	potty	training?'	For example,	if	the	delay	is	just	in	language,	there's	no	reason	he	couldn't.	But	if	the delay	 is	 in	 processing	 information,	 then	 things	 may	 not	 bode	 well	 for	 potty training	until	a	little	later	on.

Just	 because	 your	 child	 is	 delayed	 doesn't	 mean	 you	 have	 to	 forgo	 potty training.	 These	 special-circumstance	 kids	 make	 me	 think	 of	 an	 episode	 of Supernanny (my	not-so-secret	indulgence).	This	episode	featured	a	five-year-old boy	with	type	1	diabetes.	This	kid	was	a	tyrant,	completely	running	the	house. He	got	away	with	anything	and	everything	because	his	parents	were	so	fearful	of him	dying.	Supernanny	came	in	and	(a)	showed	them	a	list	of	successful	people who	lived	with	type	1	diabetes,	and	(b)	showed	them	how	their	fear	was	getting in	 the	 way	 of	 good	 parenting	 and	 setting	 appropriate	 boundaries.	 Once	 the parents	started	putting	their	foot	down,	this	kid's	behavior	not	only	improved, but	he	was	also	relieved	that	he	was	being	treated	normally.	It	made	him	less afraid	that	he	was	going	to	die.

No	 matter	 what	 is	 going	 on,	 your	 child	 deserves	 a	 healthy	 and	 normal childhood.	And	the	best	way	to	create	this	is	to	do	what	you	would	do	if	your child	 didn't	 have	 whatever	 diagnosis	 he	 carries.	 So	 don't	 necessarily	 use anything	 as	 an	 excuse	 not	 to	 potty	 train.	 Again,	 it's	 best	 to	 discuss	 your particular	situation	with	your	pediatrician	and	see	what	limitations	may	affect your	child.	Be	wary,	however.	My	experience	is	that	regardless	of	what	the	delay might	 be,	 children	 do	 best	 the	 earlier	 you	 begin	 potty	 training.	 You	 may	 be advised	to	pick	your	battles,	which	is	fair.	But	potty	training	often	gets	put	on the	back	burner,	and	then	you	have	a	five-year-old	in	diapers.	The	reality	is	that yes,	 you	 are	 going	 to	 make	 sure	 your	 child	 has	 the	 proper	 speech	 therapy	 or occupational	therapy.	But	don't	just	let	potty	training	go	by	the	wayside.	It	will get	harder	with	each	year.

Megan	 came	 to	 me	 because	 she	 has	 two	 boys	 with	 sensory	 processing disorder.	This	is	a	tricky	diagnosis,	just	by	nature.	Her	older	boy	started	potty training	at	three	years	old.	It	took	about	a	year	for	him	to	potty	train,	which seemed	normal	given	the	diagnosis.	She	had	a	gut	feeling	to	try	potty	training her	younger	at	twenty-four	months,	even	though	supposedly,	he'd	have	the	same difficulties.	He	didn't.	He	had	some	issues	with	needing	to	take	all	his	clothes off	to	poop	.	.	.	but	she	didn't	mind.	She	was	thrilled	that	it	took	so	much	less time.	She	credited	me	for	the	success,	but	I	don't	think	it	was	me.	I	think	it	was that	she	started	it	at	the	right	time.

Whatever	your	child's	diagnosis,	again,	look	to	their	other	milestones	to	get	a sense	of	 their	 learning	 curve.	 Children	 with	 autism	 spectrum	 disorder	 tend	 to really	hate	transitions-all	transitions.	Potty	training	is	one	of	the	big	ones.	You can	go	about	it	the	same	way	as	you	would	for	an	extremely	fearful	child,	if	that seems	 to	 better	 suit	 your	 child.	 Depending	 on	 your	 particular	 child,	 you	 may consider private potty consulting in conjunction	 with	 your	 occupational therapist.

## Regressions	and	Major	Transitions

We	discussed	regressions	a	bit	in	chapter	3,	'Myths	and	Misconceptions,'	but the	subject	warrants	a	little	more.	Remember,	regressions	are	backward	steps.	In potty	training,	this	means	your	accident-free	child	suddenly	starts	having	lots	of them.	Most	often,	you	hear	about	regression	when	a	family	is	expecting	a	second child,	but	really,	any	major	transition	can	cause	a	regression.

With	any	major	transition,	especially	a	new	baby	in	the	house,	of	course	your toddler	wants	attention.	Most	kids	act	out	in	some	way	with	the	new	baby.	If not	through	potty	training	regression,	it's	through	hitting	or	biting,	being	mean to,	or	simply	ignoring	the	new	baby.	This	baby	is	getting	cuddled	and	loved	and held	and	can	do	no	wrong.	Your	toddler	is	being	told,	'No,'	'Don't,'	'Stop.'	It's absolutely	 inevitable-you're	 giving	 your	 new	 baby	 more	 physical	 attention, simply	 because	 you	 have	 to.	 A	 new	 baby	 is	 helpless	 and	 demands	 it.	 So	 your toddler	 lets	 some	 of	 his	 big-boy	 skills	 slip.	 Remember:	 negative	 attention	 is better	than	no	attention	in	a	child's	mind.

How	you	address	 the	 older	 sibling's	 need	 for	 more	 attention	 is	 up	 to	 you. Many	parents	carve	 out	 special	 time	 for	 the	 toddler.	 I	 personally	 recommend telling	him	as	often	as	you	can	how	much	you	love	both	(all)	of	your	children. That	may	seem	obvious,	but	it's	shocking	how	often	we	think	our	children	know that	we	love	them.	They	still	need	to	be	told.	And	they	need	to	be	told	that your	heart	has	enough	room	for	everyone	in	your	family.

I	 also	 recommend	 really	 playing	 up	 what	 your	 older	 child	 can	 do	 and	 the baby	can't:	'Wow!	I	can't	believe	you	can	ride	a	tricycle.	Man,	your	baby	sister is	not	even close to	riding	a	big	bike	like	that!'	Or,	'Wow.	It's	so	great	that	you can	pee	on	the	potty	and	your	sister	has	to	wear	baby	diapers.	I	bet	she'll	be happy	when she can	pee	on	the	pot.	Let's	show	her	how	you	do	it,	so	she	can learn	from	you.'

Beware:	this	is	to	get	you	through	the	regression	phase.	You	don't	want	to foster	constant	competition	between	siblings.	You	do	want	your	child	to	know he's	appreciated	for	his	big-kid	skills	and	give	him	a	one	up	on	this	new,	cute intruder.	Pride	goes	a	long	way	in	potty	training.

Remember: It's	not	just	the	new	baby	and	the	attention	thing	that	can	cause	a regression.	The	whole	family	dynamic	has	been	usurped.	There	used	to	be	three people	 and	 now	 there	 are	 four.	 Schedules	 are	 mixed	 up.	 Everything	 in	 your toddler's	 world	 has	 changed,	 even	 if	 outwardly	 it	 looks	 the	 same	 (which	 is highly	unlikely).

I	maintain	that	kids	are	like	gas	tanks.	They	run	on	empty	sometimes.	And when	there's	a	new	baby	in	the	house,	just	about	everyone	is	running	on	empty. But	 here's	 the	 thing:	 it	 really	 doesn't	 take	 much	 to	 fill	 them	 up	 again.	 I'm constantly	amazed	at	this	in	my	own	parenting.	Over	a	few	days,	Pascal	will	start nudging	toward	'off'	behavior-a	little	needy,	a	little	whiny,	a	little	crankyjust	.	.	.	blech.	And	then	I'll	realize	I	haven't	really	sat	down	and	played	with him	 or	 given	 him	 one-on-one	 time	 recently.	 When	 I	 do,	 the	 behavior	 goes away.	Like	instantly.	Our	kids	don't	need	a	bunch	of	our	attention,	but	they	do need	it	 focused.	 Playing	 Candy	 Land	 or	 Uno	 or	 even	 giving	 all	 your	 focus	 to building	the	damn	Thomas	track.	Again.

Everything we	do	as	parents,	we	do	for	our	children.	Our	daily	lives	revolve around	them,	literally.	So	we	think, How	much	more	attention	could	I	possibly	give this	child? I	also	think	that	it	sometimes	feels	as	though	if	we	give	them	a	little, they're	gonna	glom	onto	us	and	never	let	us	go.	In	reality	they	need	precious little.	 But	 it	 does	 need	 to	 be	 good,	 solid	 time.	 Oh	 crap,	 here	 we	 go	 with	 the infamous	'90s	and	'quality	time	over	quantity,'	but	it's	true.	When	I	sit	and	play a	game	of	Uno-and	I	mean	sit	and	play	Uno,	no	checking	phones	or	emails	or anything	 else-Pascal's	 attention	 tank	 gets	 full.	 Presto	 magic,	 all	 the	 wonky behavior	disappears	and	he's	off	playing	by	himself	again.	I'm	always	amazed.	So don't	 carve	 out	 some	 faux	 time	 because	 that's	 what	 you've	 read	 about.	 Play something	solid	and	fill	up	your	toddler's	tank.	It	will	make	it	that	much	more understandable	to	him	when	you	have	to	sit	and	nurse	the	baby.

While	regressions	may	happen,	it's	not	a	given	that	they	will.	I've	found	that when	 you	 expect	 something	 to	 happen,	 it	 usually	 does.	 Don't	 let	 a	 fear	 of regression	stop	you	from	potty	training	your	older	child	now,	if	you're	currently expecting	number	two.	To	delay	potty	training	is	not	going	to	be	useful.	A	skill that	has	been	learned	and	dropped	is	easy	to	pick	up	again.	It	will	be	a	lot	easier to	 regroup	 and	 get	 back	 on	 track	 should	 your	 toddler	 experience	 a	 regression than	it	would	be	to	start	from	the	beginning.	It's	like	working	out.	Once	you	get in	shape	and	get	into	a	workout	routine,	even	when	you	fall	off	the	wagon	for	a while,	it's	always	easier	the	next	time	around.	You	know	what	it	takes,	and	your muscles	remember.	It's	better	to	potty	train	your	child	before	another	child	is born.	 He'll	 get	 back	 on	 track much quicker	 than	 if	 you	 were	 starting	 from scratch.

Another	point	I	want	to	make	is	that	I	have	never	personally	seen	a	huge regression.	 Most	 kids	 have	 a	 few	 accidents	 here	 and	 there,	 but	 it's	 tough	 to gauge	if	that's	from	acting	out	or	simply	that	the	parents'	attention	is	focused	on the	baby	and	not	on	prompting.

Yet	another	thing	really	worth	mentioning:	if	you	are	pregnant	right	now	and trying	to	decide	if	you	should	potty	train	before	or	after	the	baby,	maybe	nobody told	you	this,	but	one	kid	plus	one	kid	=	like	five	kids.	You	will	not	be	coming up	 for	 air	 for	 at	 least	 two	 months	 after	 the	 new	 baby	 is	 born.	 You	 may	 not believe	me,	but	I'm	telling	you	right	now.	Don't	entertain	the	notion	that	you will	be	able	to	start	potty	training	two	weeks	after	the	baby	is	born.	It	will	not happen.	 Normally,	 a	 mom	 will	 come	 to	 me	 around	 seven	 months'	 pregnant. She'll	have	a	twenty-four-month-old	and	will	be	vacillating	about	whether	she should	start	now	or	after	the	baby.	In	favor	of	starting	now:	she's	got	two	months to	seal	the	deal.	But	if	she	waits,	that's	two	months	until	the	baby	comes,	and then	another	two	months	to	come	up	for	air.	And	then	another	two	months before	 she	 really	 feels	 seminormal	 again.	 Realistically,	 we're	 looking	 at	 potty training	at	thirty	months	with	a	four-month-old	on	her	hands.	Believe	me	when I	tell	you:	shoot	for	potty	training before the	new	baby.	If	you	miss	that	window of	opportunity,	everything	will	be	that	much	harder.

Other	major	transitions	 can	 also	 cause	 regression.	 Moving	 and	 divorce	 are two	of	the	big	ones.	These	situations	are	very	stressful	no	matter	what	kind	of game	face	you	have	on.	Don't	underestimate	your	child.	She	feels	your	stress. She	absolutely	feels	the	tension	in	the	house,	even	if	you	think	you	don't	say	or do	anything	to	express	that	stress	or	tension.	Children	are	remarkably	intuitive. They	live	and	breathe	by	our	energy.

Stress	and	tension	may	be	unavoidable,	and	I	think	it's	best	to	say	things	out loud	in	terms	they	can	understand.	'You	know,	Mommy	and	Daddy	are	having	a hard	time	right	now.	Can	you	feel	it?	But	it's	okay.	We're	going	to	figure	out how	 to	 do	 what's	 best	 for	 our	 family.'	 Alternately,	 'You	 know,	 I'm	 really nervous	 about	 moving.	 Are	 you?	 And	 I've	 been	 so	 busy	 packing	 and	 getting ready,	 maybe	 I	 haven't	 been	 spending	 enough	 time	 with	 you.	 Let's	 play something.'

Don't	bring	up	the	regression	during	these	conversations.	Your	child	will	leap to	 the	 conclusion	 that	 his	 accidents	 are causing the	 issue.	 Your	 goal	 is	 to	 talk about	 the	 big,	 pink	 elephant	 in	 the	 house,	 not	 the	 symptoms	 you're	 all experiencing.

## Listen	to	Your	Child!

This	is	an	opportunity	to	let	your	child	express	her	feelings.	Once	you	open	the door,	you'll	be	amazed	at	what	children	will	say.	Just	giving	big	topics	attention will	resolve	a	lot	of	accidents	and	other	forms	of	acting	out.	Be	careful,	however, to	not	make	promises	you	can't	keep.	Talk	and	ask	questions,	even	if	it	feels	like they	are	too	young	to	understand.	The	information's	getting	in,	you	can	be	sure.

One	final	thought	on	regressions:	do	not	put	a	diaper	back	on	your	child!	I know	this	is	the	billionth	time	I've	said	this,	but	it's	that	important.	Once	potty trained,	even	in	the	beginning	stages,	putting	a	diaper	on	your	child	says	one thing	and	one	thing	only:	'I	don't	trust	you.	I'm	telling	you	all	day	how	I	know you	can	do	it	and	I	have	confidence	in	you.	But	really,	I	don't	trust	you.'	This	is extremely	damaging	to	the	whole	process.	If	you	don't	trust	your	child,	he	will never	trust	himself.

And	for	the	billionth	time	as	well:	your	energy,	your	vibe,	your	nonverbal cues	are	leading	the	show	here.	Be	sure	and	be	steady.

## CHAPTER	18

## My	Final	Answers

F inal	answers.	These	are	answers	to	the	questions	I	get	asked	over	and	over.	In theory,	there	are	no	stupid	questions	but	in	reality	.	.	.	well	.	.	.

Basically,	all	the	answers	below	are	concepts	that	are	fully	explained	in	this book	but,	I'm	often	asked	again	anyway,	so	here	are	my	unadulterated	sassy	final answers.

## Do	I	really	need	a	little	potty?

This	is	of	course,	your	call.	However,	my	final	answer:	YES.	If	you	want	to foster	independence,	you	will	need	a	little	potty.	It	also	creates	a	better	squat	for easy	elimination.	Most	parents	who	try	to	go	without	one	end	up	at	Target	at midnight	after	the	first	day	of	potty	training	to	buy	one.	It's	just	easier	to	start off	with	one.

## Can't	I	just	try	underwear?	I'm	afraid	of	.	.	.

My	final	answer: yes .	You	can	always	try	underwear.	If	you	have	some	notion in	your	head	that	commando	is	weird	or	creepy,	go	inward	and	investigate	that. I	 have	 heard	 some	 people	 are	 afraid	 of	 infection.	 I	 have	 never,	 ever	 seen	 this happen.	I	don't	recommend	panties	in	at	least	the	first	two	weeks.	If	you	want	to try	 them,	 that's	 up	 to	 you.	 You	 have	 been	 warned.	 If	 the	 panties	 get	 soaked, don't	be	attached	to	them;	ditch	them.

## Can	you	convince	me	he's	ready?

My	final	answer: no .	 I	 wrote	 this	 book.	 I've	 heard	 it	 makes	 sense.	 I	 cannot convince	you	that	your	child	is	ready.	My	final	answer	is	that	if you doubt	it,	it will	look	like	a	hot	mess.	If	you	are	unsure,	your	child	will	be	unsure.	If	she	is unsure,	you	will	be	cleaning	up	a	lot	of	pee.

## Can't	I	try	rewards?	They	worked	for	my	neighbor/friend/sister	.	.	.

My	final	answer:	this	is	up	to	you.	I	don't	care	how	you	do	this.	I	cannot	help you	clean	up	the	mess	the	rewards	create.	If	you	end	up	in	a	huge	power	struggle, that's	on	you	to	fix.	It's	not	just	a	potty	training	issue.	I	see	full-blown	disasters on	top	of potty	training	nightmares	because	of	rewards.	You	think	you	want	to try,	go	for	it.	I	have	warned	you.

## I	already	started	PTing	with	rewards.	How	do	I	stop?

My	final	answer:	just	stop.	You	can	explain	it	to	your	child	or	you	can	just say,	'Nope.	We	don't	do	that	anymore.	Mom	and	Dad	go	pee	and	poop	in	the toilet.	This	is	what	people	do.	We	don't	give	rewards	anymore.'

## I	cannot	wake	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night	for	night	training.	What	can	I do?

My	final	answer:	buy	more	diapers.	I	don't	mean	to	sound	hard-core.	No	.	.	.	I do	mean	to	sound	hard-core.	I	really	have	nothing	to	say	about	this.	If	you	know you	 are	 absolutely	 not	 in	 the	 head/physical	 space	 to	 night	 train,	 don't.	 Wait until	you	are.	But	you	are	going	to	have	to	attend	to	it.

## I	 don't	 feel	 comfortable	 giving	 a	 consequence	 for	 behavior	 around	 potty training.	What	else	can	I	do?

My	final	answer:	not	much.	If	you've	ascertained	that	you	are	indeed	dealing with	behavior	and	not	learning,	you	have	to	do	something	(please	do	be	sure that	 the	 child	 doesn't	 just	 need	 more	 learning	 time).	 I'm	 assuming	 you	 are looking	at	a	consequence	because	you	feel	like	you've	tried	everything.	Again,	a consequence	can	be	useful	for	figuring	out	if	the	child	is	capable.	There's	a	lot	of confusion	about	consequences.	I'm	not	suggesting	you	come	down	on	your	kid like	they	burned	down	your	house.	I	mean	take	away	a	Matchbox	car.	It	doesn't have	to	be	done	meanly	or	with	a	lot	of	drama.	The	idea	here	is	to	help	teach cause	 and	 effect.	 If	 you	 have no consequence/discipline	 procedure	 in	 place (outside	of	potty	training),	it's	time	to	put	some	thought	into	it.

Many	parents,	 even	 friends	 of	 mine,	 think	 consequences	 for	 the	 potty	 are unnecessary	for	a	two-year-old	and	think	it's	'wrong'	to	give	them.	I'm	here	to tell	you	the	truth:	your	two-year-old	will	become	a	five-year-old.	And	you	can't waltz	in	with	consequences/discipline	for	the	first	time	when	your	child	is	five. You	can	try,	but	it's	hard.	I	have	two	friends	that	I	had	to	'divorce'	because	they never	 believed	 in	 any	 form	 of	 discipline	 or	 consequences.	 They	 now	 have maniacs for	five-year-olds,	with	very	out-of-control	behavior.	Just	warning	you. Again,	discipline	does	not	have	to	be	mean.	It	means	having	a	boundary	and following	through.

## Our	house	setup	is	really	poorly	and	the	bathroom	is	far	away	.	.	.	what	can	I do?

My	final	answer:	move.	I'm	kind	of	kidding,	kind	of	not.	That's	up	to	you	to figure	out.	I	can't	change	your	house.	You	can	have	small	potties	all	around	the house	or	even	plastic	party	cups	in	every	room.	Get	creative.	But	it's	your	house.

## I	feel	like	my	child	is	really	ready,	but	everyone	is	really	coming	down	on	me to	not	do	this.	I	don't	want	to	push	him.

My	 final	 answer:	 f**k	 everyone. You are	 your	 child's	 parent. You are	 the expert.	If	you	feel	in	your	gut	that	your	child	is	ready	to	potty	train,	you	should not	 let	 anyone	 tell	 you	 any	 different.	 You	 should	 also	 not	 post	 on	 Facebook about	it.	I	can't	give	you	the	courage.	You	have	to	find	that	yourself.	I	trust	you and	your	gut.	That's	it.

## I	only	have	about	four	days	to	do	this,	and	then	we	are	traveling	all	summer long.	But	if	I	wait,	I'm	afraid	I'll	miss	the	window	of	opportunity.

My	final	answer:	if	you	child	is	going	to	be	three	or	older	during	this	time frame,	you	need	to	take	a	break	from	travel	and	do	this.	Now.	If	your	child	is under	thirty	months,	I	suggest	waiting.	Four	days	is	not	nearly	long	enough	to have	this	under	their	belt.	I	get	many	versions	of	this	question.	Again	.	.	.	I	can't change	your	schedule	for	you.	I	can	tell	you	this	is	a	process.	The	more	under pressure	 you	 are	 to	 get	 it	 down,	 the	 bigger	 a	 failure	 you	 will	 have.	 You	 will unwittingly	put	too	much	pressure	on	your	child	and	it	will	not	go	well.

My	child	HATES	being	naked.	What	else	can	I	do?

My	final	answer:	your	child	needs	to	be,	at	the	very	least,	bottomless.	You will	 not	 catch	 the	 pees	 unless	 you	 can	 see	 them	 starting.	 By	 the	 time	 the moisture	is	through	the	fabric,	your	child	will	be	empty	and	the	lesson	will	be lost.

## It's	freezing	here	in	\_\_\_\_\_.	Does	he	HAVE	to	be	naked?

My	final	answer:	see	my	previous	answer.	Jack	up	your	heat	for	a	day	or	two.

## We're	living	at	my	in-laws',	and	I	don't	want	any	pee	on	the	floor	.	.	.

My	 final	 answer:	 when	 you	 take	 off	 the	 diaper,	 accidents	 are	 bound	 to happen.	I	cannot	guarantee	that	no	pee	will	end	up	on	the	floor.	You	will	also be	 prone	 to	 freak	 out	 if	 some	 does,	 which	 will	 derail	 potty	 training.	 I	 cannot change	your	situation	for	you.	You	may	have	to	wait	until	you	have	other	living arrangements.

## My	kid	HAS	to	have	his	bottle	of	milk	before	bed.	He	will	pitch	a	huge	fit	if he	doesn't,	what	can	I	do?

My	final	answer:	you	are	the	boss	in	your	house.	Ditch	the	bottle.	Unless	you are	brushing	his	teeth	right	after	the	bottle,	you	are	contributing	to	your	child's tooth	decay.	Yes,	even	with	milk.	If	you	still	want	to	keep	this	practice,	go	for	it. Night	 training	 will	 be	 hard.	 Your	 child	 will	 not	 be	 able	 to	 hold	 his	 pee	 that long.	Of	course,	that's	my	experience.	Maybe	yours	can	hold	it.	Only	way	to	find out	is	to	do	it.

Sorry	if	my	sass	bothers	you,	but	it's	intentional.	I	can't	change	situations	for you,	and	I	can't	just	wave	a	magic	wand	(boy!	do	I	wish	I	could).	You	have	to	be creative	and	use	your	judgment	if	your	situation	or	your	child	isn't	the	'norm.' Everything	can	be	worked	around	if	you	examine	it	from	all	angles.

## CHAPTER	19

## Random	Tips	and	Questions

## Tips	for	the	Process

T hese	are	things	I've	found	over	the	years	to	be	tremendously	helpful.	Overall, go	with	what	works	and	be	prepared	to	fend	off	unwanted	advice.

Have	stuffed	animals,	dolls,	cars,	trains,	or	any	other	favorite	toy	'watch' your	child	use	the	potty. This	 works	 great	 the	 first	 few	 weeks.	 Kids	 love	 the idea	of	showing	off	to	an	audience	of	inanimate	objects.	It	also	works	great	for the	 child	 who	 doesn't	 want	 to	 leave	 an	 activity	 behind.	 The	 thrill	 of	 the 'audience'	seems	to	have	limited	power,	though.	Its	magic	fades	after	about	a month	or	so	(or	whenever	your	kid	gets	hip	to	your	shenanigans).

Always	offer	choices. This	works	well	in all areas	of	parenting.	Do	you	want	to use	the	big	pot	or	the	little	pot?	Do	you	want	to	go	before	Daddy	or	after	Daddy? First, this gives the child some control, which they love. Second, it automatically	 implies	 that	 whatever	 you're	 asking	 them	 to	 do is going	 to happen.	But	within	those	boundaries,	it	gives	the	child	some	control.	And	third, it	 slips	 in	 some	 learning	 about	 the	 concepts	 of	 'before'	 and	 'after,'	 and	 what they	mean.	Giving	a	choice	works	well	as	a	prompt:	'Come,	it's	time	to	pee-do you	 want	 to	 go	 first	 or	 second?'	 Giving	 choices	 is	 a	 great	 parenting	 trick	 in general	 and	 can	 smooth	 other	 difficult	 areas,	 like	 getting	 your	 child	 to	 get dressed.	Generally	speaking,	you	should	offer	two	options.	Too	many	becomes confusing.

Have	a	'poop	book'	or	two,	which	are	books	you	keep	by	the	potty	or	toilet and	read	only	while	pooping. They	 don't	 necessarily	 have	 to	 be	 about	 poop. There	are	two	reasons	for	this.	First,	it	helps	with	the	'read	every	book	in	the house'	problem.	Second,	it	acts	as	a	'prompt'	along	the	lines	of	a	nighttime	CD. [Note:	 If	 you	 don't	 already	 use	 a	 nighttime	 CD	 to	 help	 encourage	 sleep,	 you might	want	to	start.	Select	only	one	or	two	CDs	to	play	at	bedtime	and only at bedtime,	 and	 soon,	 the	 music	 becomes	 a	 cue	 for	 sleep.	 In	 a	 short	 amount	 of time,	your	child	will	fall	asleep	within	the	first	couple	of	songs.	It	won't	work	if you	 use	 the	 same	 CD	 to	 dance	 around	 to	 during	 the	 day.]	 Along	 those	 same lines-repetition	 and	 consistency-a	 poop	 book	 becomes	 a	 cue	 to	 poop,	 and soon	your	child	will	poop	within	the	first	couple	of	pages.	I'm	serious.	It's	wild how	well	this	works.

An	 added	 benefit	 is	 that	 pooping	 can	 require	 some	 concentration,	 and introducing	 new	 books	 at	 potty	 time	 will	 put	 your	 child's	 focus	 on	 the	 book instead	of	the	poop,	while	a	familiar	book	will	keep	the	focus	where	it	needs	to be.	Then,	too,	you'll	probably	have	the	poop	book	memorized	in	short	order	and will	be	able	to	recite	it	for	your	child	when	using	bathrooms	outside	your	home.

While	the	book	doesn't	have	to	necessarily	be	about	poop, Everybody	Poops and	anything	that	combines	Elmo	with	the	toilet	seem	to	be	kid	favorites.	Ditto for	 Elmo	 on	 any	 videos	 about	 poop.	 I	 personally	 don't	 think	 you	 need	 any kiddie-potty	videos,	but	if	you	can	stand	them,	have	at	it.	Elmo	=	toddler	crack. But	I'm	not	telling	you	anything	you	don't	already	know.

Respect	privacy. As	potty	training	progresses,	your	child	will	request	more	and more	privacy.	Even	in	the	beginning	phases,	however,	while	you	do	have	to	be present,	don't	get	all	up	in	your	child's	business.	Don't	keep	looking	between	her legs	or	lifting	her	butt	to	see	if	anything	is	happening.	You	can	be	right	beside her	 to	 assist	 or	 read	 without	 being	 focused	 on	 the	 action.	 Sometimes	 it	 even helps	to	look	away	or	whistle,	like	you	have	no	idea	what's	happening.

Make	it	a	habit	to	show	or	tell	your	child	where	the	bathroom	is	in	any	new setting,	 including	 stores. Something	 simple,	 like,	 'Oh,	 we're	 in	 Target	 now. You	know	they	have	a	bathroom	over	there	in	the	back.	Just	let	me	know	when you	need	to	use	it.'	When	relevant,	specify	who,	if	anyone,	is	available	to	help. This	is	great	for	when	you	have	a	play	date	at	someone	else's	home.	Kids	get confused-they	may	know	you	are	a	grown-up,	but	may	not	know	that	Pascal's mom	is	also	 a	 grown-up	 who	 can	 help.	 The	 'status'	 of	 teenagers	 can	 also	 be confusing	to	kids.	If	you	are	around	teenagers	who	are	willing	and	able	to	help your	child,	you	can	point	them	out.	This	is	important	because	accidents	tend	to happen	more	frequently	outside	of	the	home	due	to	reduced	vigilance	on	your part	and	more	distractions.	Sometimes	your	time	frame	for	getting	to	the	potty	is reduced	dramatically	when	you're	not	at	home.

Be	prepared	when	you're	going	someplace	exciting. Toy	stores,	carousels,	train stations-anything	that	thrills	your	child-will	most	likely	bring	on	a	pee	and possibly	 a	 poop.	 Remember:	 the	 anus	 is	 a	 sphincter	 muscle	 that	 opens	 with emotion.

To	 promote	 healthy	 pooping,	 be	 sure	 your	 child	 is	 adequately	 hydrated. Encourage	drinking	water	over	milk	or	 juice.	 It's	 better	 for	 you	 and	 creates	 a great	 habit.	 Be	 conscious	 you're	 not	 withholding	 liquids	 as	 a	 way	 to	 try	 to manage	accidents.

Be	creative	and	think	on	your	feet. What	works	today	might	not	tomorrow. Come	up	with	something	new.	If	you	come	up	with	a	unique	solution	that	works for	you	but	you've	never	heard	of	anyone	else	doing	it,	go	for	it!	Every	child,	and every	circumstance,	is	different.	Go	with	the	flow.	I	remember	a	former	client, Diane,	who	was	having	a	hard	time	getting	her	son	Luke	to	pee	in	the	potty. Luke	 loved	 everything	 about	 toilet	 paper.	 In	 a	 moment	 of	 insight,	 when	 she knew	he	had	to	pee,	she	put	a	square	of	toilet	paper	in	the	potty.	Luke	peed	in it! That's the	kind	of	thing	I'm	talking	about.	A	lot	of	parents	get	very	nervous and	want	to	do	everything	'by	the	book,'	literally.	 It's	 okay	 to	 use	 your	 own creative	ideas	if	they	strike.	Just	about	everything	is	okay	if	the	pee	is	landing	in the	potty	and	you're	not	doing	anything	too	weird.	I'll	leave	what	constitutes 'weird'	to	your	own	family	parameters.

Let	it	go! I	know	all	this	probably	seems	overwhelming.	Don't	worry.	It's	a	lot	of information	that	will	become	second	nature	in	a	short	amount	of	time.	You	and your	child	will	find	your	groove.	Give	your	child	the	gift	of	responsibility	and back	off.	There's	a	fine	line	between	watching	your	child	and	hovering;	learn the	difference.

## Teething

Beware	the	two-year	molars.	If	 your	 child	 suddenly	 starts	 having	 accidents,	 it could	 be	 she's	 teething.	 Teething	 the	 two-year	 molars,	 based	 upon	 my	 own observation,	 is	 hell.	 While	 all	 sorts	 of	 preteething	 goes	 on,	 when	 the	 teeth actually	break	the	surface	of	the	gums	is	the	worst	for	your	child.	It	can	bring fevers,	diarrhea,	and	really	'off'	behavior.	Do	whatever	it	is	you	do	to	manage the	pain,	and	do	your	best	to	maintain	the	status	quo.

## Getting	Sick	a	Couple	of	Days	into	Potty	Training

It's	bizarre	how	often	a	kid	will	get	sick	a	day	or	two	into	potty	training.	If	it's	a minor	cold	or	is	otherwise	bearable	in	general,	try	to	muddle	through	and	expect just	to	stay	afloat.	If	the	sickness	is	not	minor	and	your	child	is	lethargic	or	bedbound,	it's	okay	to	rediaper	and	start	fresh	when	he	is	himself	again.	He	won't learn	anything	while	he's	sick	anyway,	so	it	almost	doesn't	count.	Under	these circumstances,	rediapering	doesn't	damage	the	process	at	all.	Most	kids	seem	to recognize	 that	 they	 aren't	 capable	 when	 they're	 ill.	 We	 also	 want	 your	 child focused	on	resting	and	healing,	not	learning.

## Travel	in	the	Early	Stages	of	Potty	Training

Many	people	 have	 to	 travel	 soon	 into	 potty	 training,	 or	 live	 in	 remote	 areas where	it's	a	long	way	to	go	grocery	shopping.	Depending	on	how	your	child	is doing-and	you	will	have	a	good	sense	of	this	about	a	week	in-you	have	a	few options.	 You	 could	 put	 a	 piddle	 pad	 (also	 called	 Chux)	 down	 in	 the	 car	 seat. These	are	big	plastic	squares	with	an	absorbent	middle-think	disposable	diaper spread	out	thin.	It's	 also	 perfectly	 acceptable	 to	 use	 a	 'travel	 diaper.'	 I	 would actually	call	it	that	so	your	child	understands	it's	out	of	the	norm-it's	a	'just	in case.'	If	you	choose	to	use	a	travel	diaper,	put	it	on	last	minute	before	leaving and	 take	 it	 off	 immediately	 upon	 arrival.	 You	 should	 also	 try	 your	 hardest	 to honor	any	pee	calls	even	if	your	child	is	wearing	the	diaper.	The	travel	diaper	is especially	useful	for	long	plane	rides.	This	is	because	traveling	with	a	toddler	is stressful	enough,	never	mind	having	to	keep	a	keen	eye	on	the	potty	situation. Everything-but	 everything-is better when	 Mama's	 stress level is kept hovering	around	sane.

## Hiring	Out	the	Potty	Training

Don't	be	afraid	to	enlist	help.	I	had	a	mom	take	my	class	and	then	I	ran	into	her a	 month	 later.	 I	 asked	 her	 how	 it	 went	 and	 she	 said,	 'Fantastic.	 I	 hired	 my babysitter	to	do	it.	My	daughter	is	totally	potty	trained.'	Hire	it	out	if	you	want to!	Most	times	this	works	extremely	well	because	others	aren't	nearly	as	invested as	we	the	parents	are.	There's	no	shame	in	getting	help.

## Swim	Diapers

These	are	fine	in	the	early	stages	of	potty	training.	The	circumstances	around swimming	 are	 special	 enough	 that	 using	 them	 doesn't	 create	 confusion,	 and won't	derail	the	process.	What	will	derail	the	process	is	having	your	child	be	the one	who	poops	in	the	pool,	and	everyone	has	to	get	out,	and	all	eyes	are	on you	.	.	.	and	not	in	a	good	way.	Just	put	the	diaper	on	your	child	at	the	same time	as	the	swimsuit.	Be	sure	to	get	a	pee	before	getting	into	the	pool	and	upon getting	out.

The	same	goes	for	the	beach	and	lake.	Use	your	judgment,	though.	If	you have	a	beach	house	and	are	spending	eight	hours	a	day	on	the	beach,	you	don't want	her	in	a	swim	diaper	the	whole	time.	You	should	encourage	your	child	to get	out	of	the	water	if	she	feels	the	need	to	pee	or	poop.	And	you	should	honor this	request	as	if	there	weren't	a	diaper	on.	I	know	it	can	be	inconvenient,	but you	 are	 not	 using	 a	 diaper	 for	 convenience.	 You	 are	 using	 it	 so	 a	 big	 glaring accident	doesn't	ruin	your	life	for	a	day.

## My	Pediatrician	Said	to	Wait	Till	She's	Ready

I	 have	some	pediatricians	among	my	clients.	In	fact,	a	few	years	back,	when	a few	 pediatricians	 used	 my	 services,	 they	 asked	 to	 make	 copies	 of	 my	 book	 for their	waiting	rooms.	It's	kind	of	how	my	book	got	on	the	map,	really.	When	I switched	my	son's	pediatrician	and	filled	out	all	the	registration	paperwork,	she noticed	my	email	at	Oh	Crap!	Potty	Training,	and	asked	me	about	it.	Then	she asked	for	cards	and	brochures,	saying,	'I	would	love	to	have	someone	to	direct my	patients	to!	I	don't	potty	train	kids.'

This	makes	perfect	sense.	Over	the	years,	I've	had	innumerable	clients	tell me	they	tried	to	discuss	potty	troubles	with	their	doctor	and	the	doctor	cut	them off	with,	'Oh,	just	wait	till	they're	ready'	.	.	.	which	is	fine	unless	you know your kid	 is	 capable	 and	 just	 need	 some	 suggestions	 on	 how	 to	 get	 started	 or	 fix	 a problem	you've	encountered.

Here's	the	deal,	straight	up,	no	BS:	always	listen	to	your	doctor.	But	doctors get	paid	to	look	for	things	that	are	wrong	with	your	child.	Doctors	help	your	sick child	 get	 well	 and	 heal	 broken	 bones.	 Doctors	 find	 ear	 infections	 and	 heart murmurs.	And	realistically,	doctors	have	precious	little	time	to	spend	hearing about	your	child's	potty	training	struggles.	I	don't	mean	that	as	any	sort	of	slight against	doctors.

I	think	part	of	it	is	our	health	care	system	and	the	speed	at	which	we	need	to be	seen.	I	also	think	doctors	tend	to	look	at	moms	like	we're	whack	jobs.	Let's face	it:	we	can	all	be	a	little	crazy	in	the	doctor's	office.	Okay-I	can,	at	least.

Here	are	some	sound	bites	from	appointments	with	Pascal's	pediatrician:

'How's	he	eating?'	She's	looking	for	general	answers,	not	the	blow-by-blow	I want	to	give	her.

'How	are	his	stools?'	She's	looking	for	solid	vs.	mushy,	gray	vs.	brown,	not the	minutiae	I'd	like	to	give	her.

'He	likes	kindergarten?'	She's	looking	for	me	to	tell	her	that	everything	is normal,	not	every	frigging	cute	thing	he	tells	me	every	day.

So,	 when	the	pediatrician	asks	if	your	child	is	potty	training,	she	means	it should	 be	 on	 your	 radar.	 She	 doesn't	 want	 to	 see	 a	 poop	 log.	 It's	 just	 not	 a pediatrician's	 area	 of	 expertise,	 nor	 do	 they	 want	 it	 to	 be.	 The	 average pediatrician	hasn't	actually	potty	trained	a	variety	of	kids.	Don't	get	me	wrong -if	you	think	there's	a	medical	reason	for	your	child's	potty	training	troubles, ask!!! But	 don't	 expect	 solutions	 to	 nonmedical	 problems.	 Bottom	 line:	 your pediatrician	 is	 busy	 with	 the	 job	 of	 keeping	 your	 child	 healthy	 and	 well.	 You can't	expect	him	to	know	everything	about	everything.

## Penises	and	Potty	Training	(or	Is	It Peni ?)

The	title	says	it	all.	I	get	a	fair	number	of	inquiries	about	the	penis,	as	it	relates to	potty	training.

## Standing	to	Pee

When	do	boys	 start	 to	 stand	 up	 to	 pee?	 The	 best	 time	 to	 start	 is	 when	 he's actually	 tall	 enough	 for	 his	 penis	 to	 clear	 the	 toilet	 bowl.	 When	 they're	 first potty	trained,	this	isn't	usually	the	case.	You	don't	want	to	mess	around	with	a step	stool,	a	toddler,	and	a	big	porcelain	bowl.	When	you	start	with	the	potty, have	him	sit	on	the	potty	chair	or	toilet	insert.	These	sometimes	come	with	a pee	guard	that	I've	never	heard,	even	once,	of	working.	The	best	thing	to	do	is just	tell	him,	'Hold	your	penis	down.'	You	can	gently	put	his	legs	together	to help	him	do	this.	Most	boys	don't	mind	touching	their	penises,	so	it	shouldn't be	a	problem.	When	you	start	like	this,	it	quickly	becomes	habit.

When	he	is	tall	enough	or	old	enough	to	reach	the	potty	with	his	penis	while standing,	 you	 can	 have	 him	 push	 up	 on	 the	 skin	 right	 above	 the	 penis,	 as opposed	to	holding	the	penis	for	aim.	This	gives	him	a	great	amount	of	control and	eliminates	the	whole	'loaded	gun	in	his	hands'	issue.	Yes,	once	boys	figure out	they	can	hold	it	and	aim,	it	does	quickly	become	a	game,	so	if	you	can	stop that	from	the	get-go,	you'll	be	better	off.	I	know	some	people	suggest	cereal	in the	toilet	to	practice	aiming,	but	again,	I	think	this	just	sets	up	the	potential	for a	mess.	Plus,	it's	pee.	Do	you	really	want	to	make	a	big	game	about	it?	It's	your call.

One	thing	I	hear	a	lot	is:	'But	he	wants	to	pee	just	like	his	dad.'	Absolutely no	offense,	but	this	is	kind	of	lame.	Dad	does	tons	of	things	that	his	boy	can't	do yet.	You	can	simply	say,	'When	you	get	a	little	bit	bigger,	then	you	can	pee	like Daddy.'	Don't	make	it	an	issue,	and	your	child	won't	either.

If	you	start	off	teaching	him	to	lift	the	seat,	be	very	careful	if	you	have	any sort	 of	 cover	 on	 the	 toilet	 lid.	 The	 cover	 adds	 padding,	 and	 the	 lid	 can sometimes	slam	shut.	Good	luck	with	potty	training	after	he's	slammed	his	penis in	the	toilet	seat.	Yikes.

Also,	even	at	this	young	age,	if	there's	dribble	on	the	seat	or	bowl	edge,	teach him	 to	 wipe	 it	 off	 with	 some	 toilet	 paper.	 Future	 generations	 of	 women	 will thank	you.

## Circumcised	vs.	Uncircumcised

Is	 there	 a	 difference	 in	 potty	 training	 for	 circumcised	 versus	 uncircumcised penises?	The	answer	is	no.	The	process	is	exactly	the	same.	I	have	noticed	that with	the	foreskin	intact,	the	penis	hangs	down	a	bit	more,	which	makes	aiming a	bit	easier	at	first.	Also,	there	have	been	questions	as	to	whether	the	foreskin could	hold	a	minireservoir	of	pee.	Again,	no.	If	you've	got	a	dribbler,	it's	the	kid, not	the	penis.

Okay.	That's	all	I've	got	on	penises.	If	you've	got	a	random	penis	question, feel	 free	 to	 ask.	 I'd	 prefer	 it	 relate	 to	 potty	 training,	 but	 hey,	 I'm	 open	 to	 any random	penis	question.	I	can't	say	I'm	an	expert	but	.	.	.	you	know	.	.	.

## Other	Questions	and	Their	Answers

## When	can	I	move	the	potty	chair	to	the	bathroom?

This	is	 a	 question	 I	 get	 asked a	 lot .	 It	 is	 totally	 your	 call.	 Usually,	 it	 happens when	you	get	sick	of	the	potty	chair	being	in	the	living	room	(or	playroom	or kitchen).	 A	 lot	 of	 this	 will	 depend	 on	 your	 house	 setup.	 There	 will	 be	 an indefinable	moment	when	you	know	your	child	can	make	it	to	the	bathroom. There's	 usually	 just	 a	 natural	 progression	 toward	 your	 child	 wanting	 privacy and/or	knowing	the	bathroom	is the place	for	the	potty.	If	you	are	unsure	about whether	or	not	she	can	actually	make	it,	keep	the	potty	chair	where	it's	handy. Set	her	up	for	success-don't	put	barriers	in	her	way.

## When	can	I	switch	to	the	big	toilet?

Same	 goes	 for	 the	 switch	 to	 the	 big	 toilet	 and	 ditching	 the	 potty	 chair altogether.	Over	time,	around	a	month	or	so	after	potty	training,	you	should	be regularly	offering	the	big	toilet	over	the	little	potty,	and	your	child	should	start getting	used	to	both.	Most	kids	gravitate	toward	the	toilet,	again	with	that	sense that	 it	 is	 the	 right	 place	 to	 be.	 If	 your	 child	 really	 loves	 the	 potty,	 it's	 okay. Eventually,	the	infatuation	fades.	I've	never,	ever	had	a	weird	situation,	like	a five-year-old	who	will	only	use	the	little	potty.	Go	with	your	gut.

## When	can	I	get	rid	of	the	insert?

Once	again,	same	deal	with	the	insert.	It's	just	a	matter	of	when	your	child	is ready	to	let	it	go.	Don't	rush	ditching	the	insert.	Your	child's	bum	isn't	going	to be	big	enough	for	the	toilet	seat	for	quite	some	time,	and	if	she	falls	into	the toilet,	you	can	kiss	all	your	hard	work	good-bye.

## When	will	he	start	wiping	his	own	butt?

When	you	feel	like	you	can	deal	with	the	crappy	job	he	does	of	wiping	his	own butt.	Kidding.	No,	I'm	not.	Once	again,	your	call.	My	son	just	turned	six,	and we	split	the	duty.	You	both	will	come	to	some	agreement	at	some	point.

## How	should	I	sanitize	the	potty	chair?

Do	not	use	hard-core	sanitizers	on	the	potty	chair-a	baby	wipe	will	be	fine.	If you	are	using	Clorox	or	something	similar,	your	child	may	get	a	rash.	This	is particularly	true	of	girls,	whose	yonis	tend	to	rub	against	the	potty	chair.

## What	does	'done'	look	like?	How	will	I	know	my	kid	is	potty	trained?

There's	 no	 defined	 marker	 for	 'done'	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 potty	 training.	 Most children	 may	 have	 an	 accident	 or	 two	 after	 being	 'done.'	 You	 can't	 sayalthough	 I've	 heard	 it	 plenty-that	 once	 a	 kid	 is	 potty	 trained,	 there	 are	 no accidents.	 Our	 children	 are	 human.	 They	 can	 be	 unsure,	 scared,	 emotional, overjoyed-and	any	of	these	can	bring	on	an	accident.	They	can	be	teething,	be feverish,	have	an	ear	infection,	or	be	overtired.	Any	can	bring	on	an	accident. For	me,	I	think	'done'	is	when	potty	training	fades	into	the	fabric	of	your	life. You	will	 have	 to	 prompt	 occasionally,	 you	 will	 have	 to	 insist	 sometimes,	 you may	have	to	change	her	clothes	once	in	a	while,	but	none	of	it	will	seem	earthshattering.	For	most	moms,	they	mark	'done'	in	their	heads	with	potty	success during	increasingly	challenging	or	exciting	events. Disney	on	Ice -no	accidents -woo-hoo!!	 Went	 to	 Grandma's	 for	 three	 days-no	 accidents-woo-hoo! Took	 a	 five-hour	 car	 ride-peed	 at	 the	 rest	 stops-woo-hoo!	 Like	 any	 other skill,	your	child's	ability	to	use	the	potty	gets	better	and	better	until	you're	no longer	 thinking	 about	 it	 ALL.	 THE.	 TIME.	 On	 the	 flip	 side,	 if	 your	 child	 is having	an	accident	every	single	day	.	.	.	that's	not	'done.'	Go	back	and	tighten the	process.	Run	through	the	blocks	of	learning	real	fast.	Clean	up	the	frayed edges	a	bit.	And	remember,	don't	let	anyone	else	determine	what	'done'	means to	you	and	your	family.

## CHAPTER	20

## Parting	Words,	Mama-à-Mama

I f	 things	 start	 falling	 apart	 or	 it's	 not	 going	 as	 planned,	 try	 to pinpoint what exactly	is	going	on	and	where	it	went	wrong.	Narrow	it	down.	Most	parents	get overwhelmed	 and	 think, My	 kid	 is	 just	 not	 potty	 training .	 That's	 rarely	 true. Usually	there's	some	singular	component	that	is	messing	everything	up.	Try	to find	that	singular	component.

When	I	consult	with	parents,	that's	exactly	what	I	do.	I	strip	it	all	down	and try	to	find	and	focus	on	the	one	thing	that's	really	the	root	of	the	problem.

Break	down	the	bad	and	break	down	the good .	Bounce	between	the	blocks	if you	need	to.	Nothing	is	law,	and	nothing	is	written	in	stone.	Play	around	with backing	off	and	moving	back	in	with	prompting.	Also,	remember:	there's	no	big finish	line.	This	isn't	a	contest,	nor	is	it	a	measure	of	your	parenting	ability.

That's	 all,	 folks.	 That's	 everything	 I	 know	 about	 potty	 training,	 in	 broad sweeping	 strokes.	 I	 highly	 suggest	 you	 check	 out	 the	 blog	 and	 our	 Facebook page.	I'm	always	learning	new	things,	and	I	keep	my	thoughts	current	in	those places.

I'm	 available	 for	 one-on-one	 consulting,	 but	 I	 encourage	 you	 to	 find	 the answers	here.	Not	because	I	don't	want	to	help	you,	but	because	you	don't	need to	 lean	 on	 me.	 There's	 a	 dance	 and	 a	 rhythm	 to	 potty	 training	 just	 like everything	else. Find	your	way .	Take	what	I've	said	and	craft	it-make	it	yours and	your	child's.	Many,	many	parents	panic	the	first	day.	It's	okay.	Keep	going. You	might	feel	like	a	crappy	teacher.	Keep	going.	You	might	feel	like	your	kid	is being	utterly	ridiculous	about	this.	Keep	going.	It's	just	another	milestone-just another	something	you	are	teaching	your	child.

A	parting	thought:	while	I	have	given	you	the	curriculum,	YOU	ARE	THE EXPERT	ON	YOUR	CHILD.	You	hold	the	magic	keys.	And	I	know	you	can	do it.	And	I	know	your	kid	can	do	it.	I	have	full	faith	and	confidence	in	you.

Rock	on,	Mama!!!

## Dad's	Cheat	Sheet

(Once	again,	I	mean	no	slight	to	Dads	who	are	reading	this	and	taking	part	in potty	training.	I	know	you're	busy,	so	here's	a	quick	list.)	Hey,	dads.	So	listen. This	potty	training	thing has to	be	done	at	some	point.	The	earlier	the	better. Yes,	 I	 know	 you	 probably	 don't	 want	 to	 deal	 with	 it	 when	 you	 are	 tired	 and come	home	at	the	end	of	the	day.	And	your	partner	might	be	a	little	insane	for	a few	days.

It's	all	good. This	is	temporary. All	of	it.	Your	kid	is	going	to	be	so	proud	of himself	when	he's	done.	You	will	be	so	proud	when	he's	done.	And	you	won't	be spending	any	more	money	on	diapers.	Yay!	So	please,	please,	do	right	by	your child	and	help	with	this	as	much	as	possible.

Here	are	the	major	points	to	remember:

- ·	Your	kid	is	untrustworthy	at	this	point.	You	cannot	just	ask	him	if	he	has	to	go.	He'll	say	'no,' 'cause	it's	his	favorite	word,	and	then	you	are	screwed.
- ·	Don't ask ,	period.	Never	ask	if	he	has	to	go.	Tell	and	bring.	If	you	see	or	know	he's	got	to	go-he's dancing	around,	looking	uncomfortable-you	say,	'Come.	Time	to	pee.'
- ·	Use	your	own	leverage	as	Dad.	Your	kid	loves	you	in	a	really	special	way	that	is	different	than	how he	loves	Mom.	Use	that	power	for	good.	Enjoy	whatever	special	time	you	two	have	together,	but make	him pee	first .
- ·	Video	games,	wrestling,	TV	watching	.	.	. pee	first .	Say	that.	'You	pee	first,	and	then	we'll	.	.	.'
- •	Don't	act	helpless.	You	know	your	kid	just	as	well	as	your	partner,	but	in	a	different	way.
- •	Keep	your	eyes	open	looking	for	your	kid's	pee-pee	dance.
- ·	 Don't	 hover,	 and	 don't	 prompt	 him	 every	 two	 seconds.	 Can	 you	 imagine	 anything	 worse	 than someone	on	you	like	white	on	rice,	asking	you	to	pee	when	you	don't	have	to?
- ·	Be	casual	and	cool.	You	probably	already	have	that	role	anyway.	You	can	be	casual	and	nonchalant and	good	cop	and	still	watch	out	for	pee.
- ·	Your	partner	is	going	to	go	cuckoo.	I	promise	she'll	return	to	normal	very	soon.	Get	her	drunk.	It's okay.
- •	Do	your	best	to	help,	even	if	you	don't	want	to.	This	has	to	get	done.	Might	as	well	be	now.
- ·	Your	role	in	this	is just	as	vital as	Mom's	is.	Maybe	more.	Everyone	knows	that	Dad	is	a	little	magic.

Cheat	Sheet	for	Parents:	Reminders	of Dos	and	Don'ts	in	Each	Block	of Learning Block	One: Peeing	and Pooping	on	the	Potty	While	Naked, Either	with	Prompting	or	Without	By	far the	most	nerve-wracking	days	are	the first	few	of	potty	training.	Here's	a	few reminders	in	those	first	days:	·	Do not be	attached	to	how	long	this	block takes.	Usually	one	to	three	days	but	not always.

- ·	Look	for progress,	not	perfection!
- ·	Do not	ask if	your	child	has	to	go,	prompt	by telling .	'Come.	It's	time	to	go	to	the	potty.'
- ·	Be	watchful	without	stalking. Don't	overprompt or	hover.	This	will	create	pressure	on	the	child	and will	backfire	in	resistance.
- •	Stay	off	your	phone.
- ·	Use	easy,	natural	catch	times	(upon	waking,	before	and	after	sitting,	eating,	car	rides,	before	nap	or bedtime).
- · This	is	just	another	thing	you	are	teaching	your	child .	Lead	with	confidence,	silliness,	and	creativity.
- ·	Do not post	on	Facebook.	It	will	undermine	your	confidence.
- •	Don't	be	afraid	to	use	the	Red	Solo	Cup	Trick.
- · Do	 not	 expect self-initiation.	 If	 it	 happens,	 wonderful	 .	 .	 .	 but	 it	 won't	 be	 consistent,	 so	 it's unreliable.
- ·	All	you	are	doing	is	bringing	your	child	from	I'm	Clueless	to	I	Peed	to	I'm	Peeing	to	I	Have	to	Go Pee.	Look	for	progress	along	that	timeline.
- ·	Do	not	bribe	or	try	to	convince	your	child	to	use	the	potty.	Blend	it	in	with	other	tasks;	'Let's clean	up	your	blocks	and	go	potty	and	wash	hands	and	then	eat	lunch.'

Block	Two: Peeing	and	Pooping	on	the	Potty,	with	Clothes	On (Commando),	with	Prompting	or	Without	Remember	that	Block	Two is	the crux of	potty	training.	Most	kids	do	fine	naked;	it's	putting clothes	on	that	changes	everything.	For	some	kids,	wetting	a	few pairs	of	pants	is	perfectly	normal	before	clicking.

- ·	Use	elastic-waist	pants	for	greater	independence	and	because	they're faster to	remove.
- ·	It's	okay	to	bounce	between	Blocks	One	and	Two	for	a	day	or	two.	Get	a	good	pee	on	the	potty and	then	put	some	pants	on	for	a	while.
- •	If	poop	is	happening	in	the	pants,	go	back	to	Block	One.
- •	Dresses	are	fine	for	little	girls	(and	boys,	if	they	like	them).
- •	It's	okay	to	take	off	pants	when	you	see	your	child's	signal.
- ·	Even	if	your	child	begins	to	self-initiate,	you	should	still	prompt.	Consistent	self-initiating	should not be	expected.
- •	If	you	are	being	met	with	resistance,	back	off.	You	are	most	likely	hovering	or	overprompting.
- ·	Use	the	throwaway	prompt;	remind	your	child	to	remind	herself.	'Your	potty	is	right	over	there. Let	me	know	if	you	need	help	when	you	need	it.'
- ·	Use	the	phrase	'After	you	go	pee,	then	we	can	.	.	.	.' Don't	let	this	slip	into	bribery. There's	a	big difference.

Block	Three: Peeing	and	Pooping	on	the	Potty	in	Different Situations,	with	Prompting	or	Without	Yay!	Block	Three	is	all	about leaving	the	house!	Public	restrooms	can	be scary !	Always	get	a	good pee	before	leaving	the	house.	Make	it	part	of	the	leaving	ritual.	In

## the	early	days,	build	in	enough	time	so	you	have	some	wiggle	room to	get	that	pee	before	you	leave.

- •	Have	Post-its	in	your	purse	to	cover	the	automatic	flusher.
- ·	Bring	the	potty	chair	in	the	car	so	your	child	has	the	option	to	use	it	in	the	car	if	she	is	freaked	out by	public	restrooms.
- •	Also	carry	a	foldable	insert	with	you	in	a	ziplock	for	reducing	public	toilet	seats.
- ·	If	your	child	is	freaked	out	upon	entering	a	public	restroom,	abandon	the	mission.	Offer	the	car potty	chair.	Do	not	push	this.
- •	Always	show	your	child	where	the	restroom	is,	in	both	public	places	and	friends'	houses.
- ·	At	events	like	parties,	be	vigilant.	Excitement,	sugar,	and	more	fluids	than	usual	mean	you	need	to be	on	high	alert.	(But	don't	be	that	psycho	mom,	okay?)	·	If	your	child	can	hold	it	till	he	gets home	and	there	are	no	accidents,	that's	awesome.	Many	adults	won't	pee	or	poop	outside	their own	homes,	either.
- ·	Bring	a	spare	change	of	clothes.	Keep	some	extras	in	the	car	with	some	baggies.	Accidents	can happen	to	anyone.
- •	Make	peeing	upon	arrival	and/or	upon	leaving	part	of	your	routine.

## Block	Four: Peeing	and	Pooping	on	the	Potty	with	Underpants	On

You	are	more	than	welcome	to	try	undies	at	any	point	in	time.	Undies	fit	snug around	the	same	muscles	as	diapers	and	can	activate	the	muscle	memory	to	just pee.

- ·	If	the	first	day	of	undies	brings	on	a	lot	of	accidents	where	there	were	none,	it's	cool	to	hold	off	a bit	more.
- ·	Undies	are	a	great	natural	consequence.	If	the	child	wets	them,	they	must	go	back	to	commando	as a learning	tool ,	but	this	can	be	motivating	to	the	child,	so	use	it.
- •	Buy	a	size	up	so	the	undies	are	not	as	snug	as	the	diaper	was.
- ·	There	is	nothing	wrong	with	being	commando	for	a	long	time.	Many	adults	don't	wear	undies.	If your	child	does	well	with	commando,	that's	fine.
- •	Boxers	work	really	well.

## Block	Five: Consistent	Self-Initiation

Self-initiation	 is	 the	 by	 far	 the	 biggest	 expectation	 people	 have	 in	 potty training.	 It	 is	 normal	 and	 right	 for	 your	 child	 to	 need	 you	 to	 help	 them	 with potty	training.	Prompting	is	a	small	crutch.	Do	not	remove	it	too	soon.

- •	Reliable	self-initiation	usually	happens	within	around	three	weeks	from	your	start	date.
- · It	can	take	longer	than	that. Do	not	stress	out	unless	your	child	still	needs	you	to	prompt	every	time after	a	year.
- ·	Because	your	child	self-initiates	once	doesn't	mean	he	always	will.	Still	be	aware	of	your	child's signals	and	don't	be	afraid	to	prompt	when	needed.

## Block	Six: Night/Nap	Training	(Unless	You	Are	Doing	It	All	Together)

Night	training	is	the	most	unscientific	process	ever.	Remember	that	you	must usually	 wake	 your	 child	 at	 least	 once	 in	 the	 beginning	 because	 ten	 to	 twelve hours	is	a	long	time	to	pee.

- •	Read	chapter	6,	'Nighttime	Training,'	again.	Especially,	'Is	Night	Training	necessary?'
- ·	Begin	the	Upside	Pyramid	of	Fluids before actually	night	training.	Once	fluids	are	being	monitored, your	child	very	well	may	start	staying	dry	on	their	own.
- ·	Night	training	is possible in	a	crib.	But	easier	in	a	bed.
- · Twopiece	pajamas!!!	Sleep	sacks	will	make	night	peeing	very	hard.
- ·	 When	 possible,	 leave	 the	 little	 potty	 by	 the	 child's	 bed.	 We	 want	 to	 give	 the	 child	 every opportunity	to	do	this	on	her	own,	if	she	decides	to.
- ·	Don't	chase	time.	If	you	find	you	are	doing	everything	possible	and	there's	no	discernible	pattern, it's	 okay	 to	 rediaper	 at	 night	 for	 a	 month	 or	 two.	 While	 some	 adjusting	 of	 wake-ups	 may	 be necessary,	don't	chase	time	all	over	the	night.	Try	to	pick	up	the	child's	pattern,	if	possible.
- ·	Night	training	is never behavior.	The	child	is	never	manipulating	you	with	peeing	in	the	night.

## Block	Seven: College	.	.	.	Still	Needing	to	Prompt	Occasionally

Sort	of	a	joke,	sort	of	not.	Your	child	will	need	reminding	and	prompting	for years	to	come.	The	only	difference	will	be,	it	will	be	woven	into	the	fabric	of your	everyday	life.	There	is	no	distinct	finish	line	for	potty	training.	I	like	to	say this:	when	you	can	have	five	consecutive	thoughts	that	have	nothing	to	do	with pee	and	poop,	your	child	is	well	on	his	way.

Accidents	happen.	Molars,	big	or	small	life	changes,	daylight	savings	.	.	.	all kinds	 of	 things	 can	 affect	 the	 process.	 If	 there's	 a	 backslide,	 go	 back	 and	 run through	the	blocks	again,	super	fast.

## Jamie's	Top	Twelve	Questions	from Parents

## 1.	 Your	 book	 is	 mostly	 written	 for	 moms.	 What	 about	 us	 single	 or	 stay-athome	dads?	Don't	we	count?

Yay!	 I'm	 so	 thrilled	 you	 are	 a	 dad	 who	 is	 actively	 or	 maybe	 even	 solely handling	this	milestone.	I	truly	love	this.	The	reality	is,	even	in	this	modern	day and	age,	95	percent	of	the	people	doing	the	potty	training	are	the	moms.	In	a large	 percentage	 of	 households,	 the	 dad	 is	 still	 the	 breadwinner	 and	 still	 the parent	out	of	the	house	for	most	of	the	day.	I absolutely love	that	you,	Dad,	are doing	this,	but	I	felt	I	needed	to	address	the	larger	percentage.	But	Rock	ON with	your	Daddy-love.

## 2.	What	can	I	do	to	make	my	child	sit?	He	just	won't	sit	long	enough	to	pee.

This	 problem	 is	 usually	 in	 the	 first	 few	 days	 of	 potty	 training,	 definitely	 a Block	One	problem.	Usually	riding	it	out	with	patience	is	the	biggest	solution. The	child	just	hasn't	connected	the	dots	with	sitting	and	releasing.	Remember, just	 a	 day	 or	 two	 ago,	 he	 could	 pee	 on	 the	 run	 anywhere	 he	 wanted.	 Gently holding	him	in	place	while	you	sing	a	song	or	read	a	book	is	most	useful. You should	not	be	forcing	him	to	sit. 'Uh-uh	.	.	.	sit	down	while	your	pee	comes	out'	is a	helpful	phrase.	Carve	out	a	little	potty	corner,	have	books	and	some	favorite toys/activities	near	the	potty.	A	calm	jar	can	work	wonders.	So	can	reciting	the alphabet	or	counting.	Anything	to	distract	the	child	into	sitting.	I'm	not	a	huge proponent	 of	 screen	 time	 on	 the	 potty,	 but	 a	 short	 YouTube	 video	 can	 be helpful	 if	 your	 child	 really	 keeps	 popping	 up.	 Once	 the	 dots	 start	 to	 connect with	the	feeling	of	having	to	go	pee,	the	child	usually	begins	to	sit	still	for	the full	release.

## 3.	Pee	is	going	great.	What	can	I	do	about	poop?	She	consistently	poops	in her	pants.

Pooping	in	pants	is	common	in	the	beginning	of	potty	training	because	the pants	provide	a	layer	of	fabric	similar	to	the	feel	and	privacy	of	a	diaper.	Even though	it	makes	no	logical	sense	that	this	is	private	because	then	the	child	must be	 changed,	 it is more	 private	 than	 the	 naked	 butt.	 This	 is	 mostly	 the	 same muscle	memory	concept	for	commando.	The	fix	for	this	pooping	is	to	go	back	to the	naked	bum.	You	may	have	to	be	naked	bum	in	the	house	for	some	time.	I highly	suggest	coconut	mild	smoothies	to	keep	the	poop	really	regular.	You	may have	to	do	another	full	weekend	with	the	naked	bum.	You	don't	have	to	watch as	vigilantly	as	you	did	in	the	beginning.	Most	children	won't	poop	on	the	floor while	naked	bummed.	Remember:	again,	this	is	about habit .	For	two-plus	years, your	child	has	pooped	in	his	'pants.'	It's	about	breaking	that	habit,	right?	I	find that's	an	easier	way	to	think	about	it.	Once	you	have	several	poops	in	a	row	on the	 potty,	 the	 new	 habit	 is	 good	 to	 go.	 But	 always	 take	 away	 the	 barrier	 to success	first.	And	that	is	usually	pants.

## 4.	My	child	has	been	completely	potty	trained	for	a	while	and	suddenly	has had	eight	accidents	in	a	row.	What	is	going	on?

Any	number	of	things	can	cause	a	sudden	backslide.	Obviously,	big	changes in	 the	 child's	 life:	 a	 move,	 a	 separation,	 a	 new	 sibling.	 Sometimes	 it's	 a	 little change	to	you	but	a	big	change	to	the	child:	a	new	classmate,	a	new	teacher,	a new	routine.	It	can	also	be	a	developmental	change,	physical	or	mental,	or	new teeth	coming	in	that	throws	a	major	glitch	in	potty	training.	A	growth	spurt	can muck	 things	 up.	 If	 your	 child	 suddenly	 has	 a	 wealth	 of	 new	 skills,	 the	 potty training	ball	can	suddenly	drop	for	a	few	days.	Or	it	really	could	just	be	a	bad day	for	your	child.	First,	ascertain:	Is	this	a	pattern?	Is	it	every	day?	The	same time	every	day?	Try	to	get	to	the	root	of	what	might	be	new	or	what	the	pattern might	be.	Almost	always,	the	solution	is	a	quick	run	through	of	all	the	blocks.

As	I	 mentioned	 with	 poop,	 you	 want	 to	 take	 away	 any	 potential	 barriers	 the child	might	be	having.	Run	through	all	the	blocks	and	refresh	the	learning.

## 5.	If	I	even	mention	the	word potty ,	I	get	resistance.	What	can	I	do	when	my kid	is	screaming	no	at	the	mere	mention	of	the	potty?

When	a	child	is	presenting	you	with	a	ton	of	resistance,	it	most	often	means you	are	putting	too	much	pressure	on	the	process.	You	might	be	prompting	too much,	 you	 might	 be	 staring	 them	 down	 watching	 for	 a	 pee,	 you	 might	 be hovering	too	much	within	a	prompt.	I	talk	about	this	prompting	a	lot	in	chapter 5,	'Ditch	the	Diapers!	The	How-To.'	You	have	to	back	off	and	allow	the	child to:	(a)	make	mistakes,	and	(b)	fully	own	this.	I	realize	it's	not	easy.	It's	finding	a delicate	 balance	 between	 being	 vigilant	 and	 putting	 pressure	 on	 the	 child. Hovering	within	the	prompt	is	a	common	pressure.	You	prompt	your	child	and then	bug	him	till	he	goes.	You	want	to	prompt	but	be	willing	to	let	it	go	and prompt	again	later	if	your	child	says	no.	I	imagine	that	being	told	you	have	to pee	when	you	don't	is	probably	very	annoying.	Also,	a	kitchen	timer	can	be	very useful.	 Usually	 the	 child	 is	 resisting	 you	 the	 parent	 reminding	 him,	 not	 the actual	potty.	Set	the	timer	either	at	intervals	that	are	normal	for	your	child's	pee pattern	or	set	it	for	a	few	minutes	when	you	think	he	is	showing	a	signal.

## 6.	My	child	dribbles.	All.	Day.	Long.	They	are	not	full	accidents.	How	can	I stop	him	from	dribbling?

Dribbles	 are	 totally	 normal	 and	 very	 common.	 It's	 important	 to	 remember how	much	control	your	child	is	showing	with	dribbles.	They	are	starting	to	pee and	 stopping	 themselves	 to	 get	 to	 the	 potty. That's	 great! Dribbles	 usually indicate	that	your	child	is	waiting	to	see	how	long	she	can	hold	it,	which	is	also an	important	part	of	the	process.	The	dribbles will stop.	In	the	meanwhile,	you can	buy	old-school	training	pants,	that	have	a	triple	layer	of	thickness	in	the crotch	but	are	underwear.	You	also	want	to	highlight	the	good	while	addressing the	bad,	'Oops.	I'm	so	glad	most	of	your	pee	was	in	the	potty.	A	little	is	in	your pants.	Next	time,	run	to	the	potty	when	you	have	the	feeling	to	go	pee.'	Have the	 child	 change	 her	 own	 pants	 if	 possible	 and don't	 make	 a	 huge	 deal	 about dribbles .

## 7.	She	sits	and	sits	and	sits	and	poop	doesn't	come.	Ten	minutes	later,	she's up	and	dressed,	and	it's	in	her	pants.	How	can	I	get	that	poop	to	come	out	on the	potty?

So	there's	good	news	here.	I	always	look	for	the	good	news	first.	Either	you	or she	or	maybe	both	of	you	are	fully	aware	of	the	feeling	of	having	to	go	poop. That's	awesome!	The	sitting	is	good,	she's	probably	just	having	trouble	releasing the	 poop.	 The	 Play-Doh	 trick	 (both	 in	 the	 book	 and	 on	 YouTube)	 is	 an awesome	fix	for	this.	Sometimes	children	just	need	a	visual	for	what's	going	on. The	other	big	fix	is	to	start	using	a	term	for	releasing	the	anus/sphincter	muscles. Most	kids	really	resonate	with	'your	poop	gate.'	'Just	open	your	poop	gate	and let	 the	 poop	 slide	 out.'	 Use	 passive	 words	 like slide as	 opposed	 to push .	 Using language	like	'open	your	poop	gate'	sends	the	message	that	this	is	something your	child	is	in	control	of	and	that	is super helpful	for	the	child	to	know.

## 8.	You	make	it	sound	like	potty	training	after	three	years	old	is	going	to	be horrific.	I	was	scared	that	I	had	waited	so	long,	but	I	had	tried	before,	and my	 child	 just	 wouldn't	 potty	 train.	 Well,	 I	 found	 your	 book,	 and	 it	 went great!	Why	do	you	make	it	sound	so	awful	for	three-year-olds	and	over?

Yay!	I'm	so	glad	it	went	well	for	you.	I	make	it	sound	horrific	because	in	my experience	 it	 usually	 is.	 The	 threes	 are	 an	 incredible	 time	 of	 developmental growth	 for	 children.	 They	 begin	 to	 individuate,	 which	 is	 the	 psychological process	 of	 learning	 they	 are	 separate	 from	 you,	 the	 parent.	 This	 brings	 about huge	leaps	in	'free	will'	as	witnessed	by	the	tantrums	and	amount	of	'no's	you get	 once	 your	 child	 hits	 year	 three.	 Yes,	 a	 three-year-old	 will	 have	 more language	 and	 more	 understanding,	 and	 that	 might	 ease	 the	 process	 of	 potty training.	However,	a	three-year-old	will	also	have	more	understanding	of	your buttons	and	when/how	to	push	them.	If	you	and	your	three-year-old	have	power struggles	over	which	shoes	she	will	wear,	imagine	the	power	struggles	you	will have	 when	 your	 child literally	 holds	 the	 power .	 The	 behavioral	 aspect	 of	 potty training	has	the	potential	to	be	horrific.	I've	seen	it	firsthand.	So	my	warning	is not	meant	to	make	you	feel	bad	or	guilty	that	your	child	is	past	the	window	of opportunity.	It's	meant	to	warn	you:	get	on	it	ASAP	and	be	prepared	for	a	lot	of behavior.	If	it	doesn't	happen,	that's fabulous .

## 9.	I'm	too	nervous	to	try	night	training	right	away,	but	I'm	thinking	about doing	nap	training.	Can	you	tell	me	how	to	nap	train?

I	 know	that	night	training	can	look	terrifying	at	first,	and	I	commend	you knowing	 that	 you	 are	 not	 ready	 to	 jump	 in.	 I	 have	 written	 many	 blog	 posts about	night	training.	However,	it	is	not	possible	to	'nap	train.'	There	is	nothing we	can	do	to	assist	the	child	(with	night	training,	you	will	assist	by	waking	him at	 least	 once).	 We	 can't	 wake	 a	 napping	 child.	 The	 best	 thing	 to	 do	 is	 limit fluids	 with	the	Upside	Down	Pyramid	of	Fluids,	have	her	go	right	before	nap, and	see	if	she	stays	dry.	If	she	does	stay	dry	for	a	few	days	in	a	row,	I	would	ditch the	nap	diaper.	But	other	than	that,	there	isn't	any	way	to	solely	train	for	naps.

## 10.	I'm	a	wreck.	We're	night	training.	I've	tried	everything.	Everything	in the	book,	and	it's	still	hit	or	miss.	We	are	all	losing	sleep.	What	else	can	we do?

It's	 very	 okay	 to	 rediaper	 for	 night	 training.	 Please	 remember: sleep	 trumps potty	training .	If	you've	given	night	training	a	very	solid	try,	and	it's	still	all	over the	map,	give	it	a	break.	Having	both	parents	and	child	exhausted	will	implode your	entire	life.	The	important	thing	to	remember	is	that	night	training	is	never, ever	behavior;	it's	never	the	child	toying	with	you.	You	can	always	try	again	in	a month	or	two,	but	for	now	.	.	.	rest.

## 11.	What	do	you	recommend	for	pottying	gear?

I	 recommend	the	Björn	potty	chair	for	its	simplicity	and	low-to-the	ground squat	factor.	I	highly	discourage	the	potty	chairs	with	a	ton	of	bells	and	whistles. This	isn't	a	toy;	it's	a	toilet.	A	sturdy	stool	or	better	yet,	a	squat	stool	like	the Squatty	 Potty	 will	 help	 encourage	 independent	 toilet	 use.	 I	 recommend	 the Potette	for	a	travel	potty.	Any	sort	of	piddle	pads	for	car	seats	and	beds.	Brolly sheets	 come	 highly	 mom	 recommended	for	waterproof	sheets.	 I	 recommend	 a foldable	toilet	insert	(seat	reducer)	for	both	at	home	and	travel.	There	are	tons of	 variations	 on	 all	 these	 products.	 A	 quick	 Google	 search	 will	 help	 you determine	 the	 best	 products	 for	 your	 needs.	 I	 always	 recommend	 plain	 and functional	to	help	normalize	the	whole	process.	Oh!	And twopiece	pajamas.

## 12.	When	can	boys	start	to	stand	to	pee?

My	general	rule	of	thumb	is	when	they	are	tall	enough	for	their	penis	to	clear the	bowl.	It's	impossible	to	stand	up	to	pee	at	the	little	potty	chair	because	of splash	back.	And	until	he	is	tall	enough,	you	will	have	to	use	a	step	stool.	And	a little	boy,	standing	at	a	porcelain	bowl,	with	his	penis	in	his	hand	will	probably not	 be	 focused	 on	 balance.	 He	 can	 do	 this	 with	 your	 help,	 but	 I	 strongly encourage	as	much	independence	as	possible,	so	sitting	on	the	little	pot	is	the best	way	to	go	for	a	while.
